# Literature Review Workflow

## Purpose

Systematic workflow for conducting comprehensive literature reviews including search strategy development, source screening, quality assessment, and synthesis.

## Context Required

- Research question or topic area
- Relevant databases and search engines
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Time period for literature coverage
- Citation style requirements

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Define Review Scope

**Objectives**:
1. Clarify research question
2. Define search parameters
3. Establish inclusion/exclusion criteria
4. Identify relevant databases

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write clear research question(s)
- [ ] Define key concepts and terms
- [ ] List synonyms and related terms
- [ ] Specify date range for publications
- [ ] Determine inclusion criteria (study types, populations, outcomes)
- [ ] Determine exclusion criteria (language, publication type)
- [ ] Select databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, etc.)

**Output**: Search protocol document

---

### Stage 2: Develop Search Strategy

**Search Components**:

1. **Keywords and Phrases**:
   - Primary terms (core concepts)
   - Secondary terms (related concepts)
   - Synonyms and variants
   - Acronyms and abbreviations

2. **Boolean Operators**:
   - AND: Combine different concepts
   - OR: Include synonyms
   - NOT: Exclude irrelevant terms

3. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Wildcards (*): Capture variations (e.g., "analy*" for analyze, analysis, analytical)
   - Phrase search (""): Exact phrase matching
   - Field codes: Limit to title, abstract, keywords

**Example Search String**:
```
(("climate change" OR "global warming") AND
 ("agriculture" OR "farming" OR "crop*") AND
 ("adaptation" OR "resilience"))
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create search string for each database
- [ ] Test search with broad terms
- [ ] Refine to balance precision and recall
- [ ] Document final search strings
- [ ] Plan search order (most to least relevant databases)

**Output**: Documented search strings per database

---

### Stage 3: Execute Searches

**Process**:

1. **Systematic Search**:
   - Search each database using refined strings
   - Record search date and database version
   - Export results with full citations
   - Document number of results per database

2. **Tracking**:
   - Create search log spreadsheet
   - Columns: Database, Date, Search String, Results Count
   - Save raw search results files
   - Note any search modifications or issues

3. **Supplementary Searches**:
   - Citation chaining (forward and backward)
   - Grey literature (reports, theses, preprints)
   - Hand searching key journals
   - Expert recommendations

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Execute planned database searches
- [ ] Export and save raw results
- [ ] Document search details in log
- [ ] Perform citation chaining on key papers
- [ ] Search grey literature sources
- [ ] Record total results before deduplication

**Output**:
- Search log spreadsheet
- Raw search result files
- Total initial result count

---

### Stage 4: Screen and Select

**Level 1: Title and Abstract Screening**

1. **Deduplication**:
   - Import all results to reference manager
   - Use automatic duplicate detection
   - Manually check suspicious duplicates
   - Document removal count

2. **Initial Screening**:
   - Review title and abstract against criteria
   - Mark as: Include, Exclude, or Uncertain
   - Document exclusion reasons
   - Have second reviewer screen sample (10-20%) for reliability

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - Include if meets all inclusion criteria
   - Exclude if clearly irrelevant
   - Move uncertain to full-text review
   - Err on side of inclusion at this stage

**Level 2: Full-Text Screening**

1. **Obtain Full Texts**:
   - Download or request all included/uncertain papers
   - Track papers not accessible
   - Document retrieval issues

2. **Detailed Review**:
   - Read full text against inclusion criteria
   - Assess study quality
   - Check for sufficient data/detail
   - Final include/exclude decision

3. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Apply quality criteria for your field
   - Rate: High, Medium, Low quality
   - Note methodological concerns
   - Consider sensitivity analysis excluding low-quality studies

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove duplicates and document count
- [ ] Screen titles/abstracts
- [ ] Calculate inter-rater reliability (if team)
- [ ] Resolve disagreements
- [ ] Obtain full texts
- [ ] Complete full-text screening
- [ ] Document reasons for exclusions
- [ ] Create PRISMA flow diagram

**Output**:
- Deduplicated library
- Screening decisions with reasons
- PRISMA flow diagram
- Final included studies list

   - Key conclusions
   - Limitations noted

4. **Domain-Specific Data**:

- [ ] Organize studies by chosen framework
- [ ] Identify major themes or patterns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Too Broad**: Start focused, expand if needed
2. **Inadequate Search**: Use multiple databases, various terms
3. **Publication Bias**: Include grey literature, unpublished studies
4. **Selective Reporting**: Report all findings, not just supporting
5. **Poor Documentation**: Track all decisions and reasons
6. **Quality Neglect**: Assess and report study quality
7. **Synthesis Weak**: Go beyond summary, identify patterns and gaps

---

## Tips for Success

### Efficiency
1. Use reference manager from the start
2. Create templates for screening and extraction
3. Batch similar tasks together
4. Track progress in task management system

### Rigor
1. Document all decisions
2. Use at least two databases
3. Have screening criteria clear before starting
4. Consider second reviewer for reliability
5. Report what you did, not just what you found

### Quality
1. Allow sufficient time (reviews take longer than expected)
2. Pilot test screening and extraction
3. Stay organized (file naming, version control)
4. Update search before finalizing (if lengthy process)
