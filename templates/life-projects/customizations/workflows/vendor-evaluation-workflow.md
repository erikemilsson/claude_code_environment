# Vendor Evaluation Workflow

Process for finding, vetting, selecting, and managing vendors and contractors.

## Purpose

Effective vendor selection ensures:
- Quality workmanship
- Fair pricing
- Professional reliability
- Clear communication
- Project success

## When to Use Professionals

### Hire Professionals For:

**Safety-critical work:**
- Electrical (code compliance, safety)
- Structural (load-bearing changes)
- Gas lines (explosion/carbon monoxide risk)
- Plumbing (major work, code requirements)
- Roofing (fall risk, water damage)

**Code-required work:**
- Permitted work requiring licensed contractor
- Inspections by certified professionals
- Work affecting home insurance

**Specialized skills:**
- HVAC installation and repair
- Drywall finishing (quality matters)
- Tile work (precision and waterproofing)
- Hardwood floor installation
- Custom carpentry or cabinetry

**Time/value trade-offs:**
- Learning curve exceeds time available
- Tools cost more than hiring out

- Your time is better spent elsewhere

### Consider DIY For:

- Painting and decorating

- Basic landscaping
- Organization and decluttering

## Vendor Finding Process

### Step 1: Get Recommendations

**Best sources (in order):**

   - Recent work you can see and discuss
   - Honest feedback on experience

2. **Professional referrals**
   - Other contractors you trust

   - Architects or designers

3. **Online reviews**
   - Google, Yelp, Angie's List
   - Focus on recent reviews (last 6 months)
   - Read both positive and negative
   - Look for patterns, not individual complaints

4. **Trade organizations**
   - Local chamber of commerce
   - Better Business Bureau
   - Professional associations

**Initial list:** Aim for 5-7 candidates to contact

### Step 4: Site Visit and Estimate

**During estimate appointment:**

**Prepare:**

- Budget range in mind (but don't share yet)

**Contractor should:**
- Show up on time (or call if delayed)
- Spend adequate time assessing
- Ask questions about scope and goals
- Take measurements
- Explain approach and options
- Discuss timeline and process
- Provide ballpark estimate or quote timeframe

**You should ask:**

- Experience with this type of work
- Approach to this specific project
- Timeline and availability
- Who does the work (them vs subcontractors)
- How they handle issues or changes
- References from recent similar work
- License and insurance confirmation
- Payment structure
- Warranty or guarantee

**Red flags:**

### Step 5: Compare Quotes

**Request itemized quotes with:**
- Labor breakdown by trade
- Materials list with quantities and specs
- Timeline with phases
- Payment schedule
- Warranty or guarantee terms
- Change order process
- What's included and excluded

**Create comparison matrix:**

| Item | ABC Plumbing | XYZ Contractors | Quality Bath Co |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Total Price** | $8,500 | $7,200 | $9,800 |
| Labor | $5,500 | $4,800 | $6,200 |
| Materials | $3,000 | $2,400 | $3,600 |
| Timeline | 2 weeks | 3 weeks | 10 days |
| Warranty | 1 year | 90 days | 2 years |
| Reviews | 4.8/5 (120) | 4.2/5 (45) | 4.9/5 (200) |
| Years in business | 12 years | 3 years | 25 years |
| Licensed/Insured | Yes/Yes | Yes/Yes | Yes/Yes |
| References | 3 provided | 2 provided | 3 provided |
| Responsiveness | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| Professionalism | High | Medium | High |
| **Overall Score** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |

**Evaluate:**
- Don't automatically pick cheapest
- Value matters more than price alone
- Verify scope is truly comparable
- Consider intangibles (communication, trust)

### Step 6: Check References

**For top 2-3 candidates:**

**Call recent customers (within 6 months):**

Questions to ask:
- What work did they do for you?
- How was the quality of workmanship?
- Did they complete on time?

- How was communication throughout?
- How did they handle any issues?
- Was job site kept reasonably clean?
- Would you hire them again?
- Any concerns or suggestions for me?

**Visit completed work if possible:**
- See quality firsthand
- Ask homeowner about experience
- Check if details are well-executed

### Step 7: Make Selection

**Decision factors (in order):**
1. Quality and reliability
2. Reasonable price (not cheapest, not most expensive)
3. Communication and professionalism
4. Timeline fit
5. Gut feel about working relationship

**Document decision:**
