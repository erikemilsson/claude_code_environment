# Project Specification

<!--
Start with what you know. Common sections include:
- Overview (what it does, who it's for, what problems it solves)
- Architecture (components, how they connect, key decisions)
- Requirements (what it must do, constraints, what's out of scope)
- Acceptance Criteria (how you'll know it works)
- Open Questions (what's still undecided)

But use whatever structure fits your project. Run /iterate to build this out.
