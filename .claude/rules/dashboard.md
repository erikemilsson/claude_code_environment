# Dashboard Rules

## Navigation Hub

The dashboard at `.claude/dashboard.html` is the primary navigation hub during the build phase — a **single read-only, offline, `file://`-openable HTML page** (DEC-024). It surfaces what needs attention with links to specific files (spec, decisions, tasks). The user reads it for overview and acts via the CLI; it is not edited in-place.

## Interaction Modes

Not everything routes through the dashboard:
- **Dashboard-mediated** (default) — async overview: progress, decisions, phase-gate readiness, what needs the user
- **CLI-direct** — synchronous tasks: testing a CLI, confirming output, quick yes/no, approving a phase gate

The dashboard remains the default read surface. Because it is read-only, every action the user takes happens via the CLI (the dashboard's "Needs you" card names the action + the command).

## Regeneration Strategy

The dashboard is regenerated whole by the script (`dashboard-render.py --html`) — there is no in-file targeted-edit path (the HTML is not hand-edited). Two tiers:
- **Tier 1 (Strategic Regen):** Decomposition complete, parallel batch end, session boundaries, `/work complete`, phase gates, decision resolution, Step 1a freshness mismatch, format staleness
- **Tier 2 (Inline CLI Messages):** Brief contextual updates for routine changes — task starts, verification passes/fails — no regen

A full regen is cheap (a single script call), so any Tier-1 trigger runs a full regen.

**Script-first (DEC-024):** full regens render the entire HTML — structural sections + inline-SVG visualizations — via `python3 .claude/scripts/dashboard-render.py --html`. The orchestrator writes the output, then fills only the synthesis placeholders (the Action Required "Needs you" card, Custom Views content) with HTML. See `dashboard-regeneration.md § "Script-First Rendering — HTML target"` for the division of labor and the canonical `task_hash` mode.

## Sections

Section visibility is controlled by `section_toggles` in the `.claude/dashboard-state.json` sidecar (the read-only HTML has no in-file checklist — edit the sidecar or ask Claude to toggle a section):
- 🚨 Action Required ("Needs you" card) — decisions, tasks, reviews needing user input. **LLM-filled.** **Human-gated coverage invariant:** every item blocked on the user — `owner: human` tasks with satisfied dependencies, `owner: both` tasks awaiting review, On Hold tasks, unresolved decisions, and unanswered questions from a paused session — must appear here with the concrete question/action inline; handoff prose must never be a blocking item's only home. `/work` prints this queue at session start (Step 0g) and sweeps it at pause.
- 📊 Pulse + Phase map — completion ring, status donut, count chips, phase heatmap, active-front cards
- 🔀 Flow — inline-SVG dependency graph + critical path (auto-hidden when degenerate)
- 🗓️ Timeline — due dates / external dependencies (when present)
- 📋 Decisions — collapsed, link-out + in-file search (demoted to a stat; omitted at 0–1)
- 📄 Specification — link-out card listing section headings (not embedded)
- 💡 Notes — read-only card from sidecar `user_notes` (seeded with quick links on first regen)
- Optional: 👁️ Custom Views (toggle via the sidecar)

## Scaling

The dashboard auto-adapts to project size:
- **Completed phases** collapse into the heatmap (one cell each) rather than repeated headers
- **Phase heatmap** keeps even 50+ phases scannable as a compact grid
- **Dependency graph** auto-hides when degenerate (<4 incomplete task nodes, no edges, or a cycle); >15 task nodes reduce to the critical path + immediate neighbors
- **Decisions** collapse to a single searchable stat regardless of count (styler: 141 → one line)
- **Spec** is linked-out, not embedded, so the file stays light (~25–150 KB) regardless of spec size

## Dashboard State

The dashboard ships as a populated HTML format example (fictional renovation project) carrying a `<!-- FORMAT EXAMPLE -->` comment marker. On first `/work` run after spec decomposition, it is regenerated with actual project data (the marker is absent from generated output, so it is detected and replaced exactly once).

User content lives **only** in `dashboard-state.json` (the sidecar): `section_toggles` (which sections render) and `user_notes` (the Notes card). The HTML has no editable markers — the sidecar is the single source of truth.
