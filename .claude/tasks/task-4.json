Findings: (1) File paths consistent - all use .claude/context/ and .claude/tasks/ correctly; (2) Terminology aligned - 'Spec → Plan → Execute → Verify' used consistently, status values match; (3) Handoff protocols clear - agent-handoff.md documents Orchestrator↔Specialist format, each agent has Inputs/Outputs sections; (4) Workflow alignment verified - CLAUDE.md, workflow-guide.md, and all agents agree on phase definitions and transitions. No issues found requiring fixes. The system is coherent as a whole.",
