Project bootstrapping (copy template, add source docs, customize overview)\n2. Complete Phase 0 workflow walkthrough:\n   - Step 1: Initialize project (analyze docs, extract 23 ambiguities)\n   - Step 2: Resolve ambiguities (interactive, with domain expert)\n   - Step 3: Generate artifacts (glossary, data contracts, manifest, tasks)\n   - Step 4: Extract queries (from Excel, enable watch mode)\n3. Phase 1 implementation:\n   - Task selection strategy\n   - complete-task.md command walkthrough\n   - Example implementation (Bronze_Source_BatteryData)\n   - Schema validation against data contracts\n4. High-difficulty task breakdown:\n   - breakdown.md command for difficulty 9 task\n   - 5-dimension scoring calculation\n   - Generated 7 subtasks (each ≤6 difficulty)\n   - Automatic parent completion workflow\n5. Time comparison (with vs without Phase 0)\n6. Artifacts created and regulatory audit readiness\n7. Minimal approach comparison (when to use each)\n\nShows both minimal and comprehensive approaches with clear decision criteria."
