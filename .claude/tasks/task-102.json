  "description": "Enhance bootstrap completion messages and command outputs with context-aware suggestions for what to do next. Based on template type, phase, and project state, provide smart recommendations (e.g., 'Run Phase 0 Step 1' for new Power Query projects, 'Create first task' for standard projects). This reduces user decision fatigue and guides workflow.",

Complements tiered information display (task 90).\n\nCOMPLETION NOTES (2025-12-18):\n- Enhanced 3 command files with context-aware next-step suggestions:\n  * complete-task.md - 8 context scenarios (parent complete, siblings remain, Phase 0 done, high-diff tasks, blocked tasks unblocked, all complete, standard continuation)\n  * sync-tasks.md - 8 analysis scenarios (critical risks, high-diff breakdown needed, blocked tasks, confidence declining, momentum stalled, healthy systems, project complete, Phase 0 progress)\n  * bootstrap.md - 4 template-specific paths (Phase 0 enabled, initial tasks created, no tasks created, life projects/simple)\n- smart-bootstrap.md already had excellent context-aware suggestions (verified, no changes needed)\n- All suggestions include time estimates and clear action commands\n- Suggestions prioritized by urgency (risks > blockers > breakdowns > continuation)\n- Task suggestion priority rules established (6 criteria: unblocks, same parent, related tags, high priority, lower difficulty, sequential)\n- Task completed at good velocity (70) - clear enhancement patterns, consistent formatting",
