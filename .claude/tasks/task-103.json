Current error messages could be more helpful and actionable.\n\n=== ERROR MESSAGE IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS ===\n\n**Current State**: Error messages exist but lack actionable guidance\n\n**Identified Error Categories**:\n\n1. **File Not Found Errors**\n   - Current: \"Error: Could not find specification document at [path]\"\n   - Issues: No guidance on why path failed, no suggestions for fixing\n   - Common causes: Wrong path format, file in different location, typo in filename\n\n2. **Directory Conflict Errors**\n   - Current: \"ERROR: Environment already exists\"\n   - Issues: No guidance on what to do next, no context about why this matters\n   - Common causes: Re-running bootstrap in same directory, wrong directory\n\n3. **Template Detection Issues**\n   - Current: \"Warning: Specification lacks clear indicators...\"\n   - Issues: Some guidance but could be more specific about what to add\n   - Common causes: Vague spec, missing keywords, wrong template type\n\n4. **Path Expansion Issues**\n   - Current: No explicit error handling documented\n   - Issues: Users don't understand ~ expansion, relative paths, iCloud paths\n   - Common causes: Mac-specific path formats, spaces in paths, special characters\n\n5. **Validation Failures**\n   - Current: Generic warnings without resolution steps\n   - Issues: User doesn't know how to fix the issue\n   - Common causes: Empty files, wrong format, missing sections\n\n=== ERROR MESSAGE IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK ===\n\n**Standard Structure for All Errors**:\n\n```\n[ICON] [SEVERITY]: [What happened]\n\n📍 Where: [Location/context]\n🔍 Why: [Root cause explanation]\n💡 Fix: [Step-by-step resolution]\n🔗 Related: [Helpful commands or docs]\n```\n\n**Severity Levels**:\n- ❌ ERROR: Cannot proceed, must fix\n- ⚠️  WARNING: Can proceed but should address\n- ℹ️  INFO: Helpful context, no action needed\n\n**Example Transformation**:\n\nBEFORE:\n```\nError: Could not find specification document at [path]\nPlease provide the path to your project specification (.md file from Claude Desktop)\n```\n\nAFTER:\n```\n❌ ERROR: Specification file not found\n\n📍 Where: Looking for file at \"~/project/spec.md\"\n\n🔍 Why this happened:\n   • File doesn't exist at this path\n   • Path may have typo or incorrect location\n   • File might be in a different folder\n\n💡 How to fix:\n\n1.
