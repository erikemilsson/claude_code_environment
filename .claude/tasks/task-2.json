Decide between semantic versioning (v1.0.0) vs date-based (2026-01-26). Create version file(s) likely at .claude/version.json for both lite/ and standard/ templates, plus root repo version.",

Created version.json at three levels: root (.claude/version.json), lite (lite/.claude/version.json), and standard (standard/.claude/version.json). Schema includes template_version, template_release_date, template_name, source_repo, project_version, project_initialized, and notes fields. Semantic versioning chosen for communicating breaking changes; date provides quick release reference.",

Template versions (lite/, standard/) are what users copy - they track the template version the project was bootstrapped from.",
