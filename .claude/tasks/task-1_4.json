Verify: (1) Basic task validation works correctly, (2) CLAUDE.md audit catches bloat appropriately, (3) Sync comparison detects drift and reports accurately, (4) Auto-fix options work as documented. Update the command documentation with actual examples and any discovered edge cases. Ensure the command works when copied to a new project (bootstrap scenario).",

Sync-manifest.json already includes .claude/commands/*.md so health-check.md will be synced. Final line counts: lite=300, standard=385.",
