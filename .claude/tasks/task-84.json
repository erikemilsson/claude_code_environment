  "completion_notes": "Investigated pattern library and found it is FULLY IMPLEMENTED with 13 comprehensive patterns totaling 4,294+ lines of content. Task description was incorrect - the library is not empty. Patterns include: 3 file operations, 3 code generation (Python), 3 data operations (CSV/JSON/Excel), and 4 Microsoft Stack (Power Query Bronze/Silver, DAX, Dataflow Gen2). Each pattern follows standard format with metadata, triggers, parameters, templates, anti-patterns, examples, and testing checklists. Commands exist (find-pattern.md, apply-pattern.md) for pattern usage. No action needed - library is complete and comprehensive.",
