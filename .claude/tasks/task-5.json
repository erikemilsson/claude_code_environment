Current breakpoints: 1-2 (routine, just do it), 3-4 (standard, may take multiple steps), 5-6 (substantial, design decisions needed), 7-8 (MUST break down), 9-10 (MUST break into phases). Evidence: Tasks 1_1-1_4 (difficulty 3-6) completed successfully without breakdown. Task 1 (difficulty 7) correctly decomposed into 4 subtasks. Extended thinking triggers align: difficulty 7-8 → 'think harder', 9-10 → 'ultrathink'. The 'one focused session' heuristic effectively determines the 6/7 boundary. No changes needed - scale appropriately balances Opus 4.5's enhanced reasoning with practical decomposition needs.",

Opus 4.5's enhanced reasoning justifies keeping difficulty 5-6 as 'just do it with steps' while the 7+ breakdown threshold remains appropriate for context-heavy multi-file work."
