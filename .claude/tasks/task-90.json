Show only the most important immediate next step first, then provide optional detailed information on request. This reduces information overload (current: 20-30 lines) and makes the next action crystal clear. Include estimated time for next steps.",

  "notes": "HIGH IMPACT - Phase 1 Quick Win. COMPLETED: Redesigned bootstrap completion message in smart-bootstrap.md (lines 735-936) with tiered information architecture. Tier 1 (Essential): Shows only immediate next step in 10-12 lines with time estimates, project name, template, and one clear action. Tier 2 (Detailed): Full configuration, file list, detailed next steps, time estimates - shown only on request ('show details'). Includes 3 complete examples showing Phase 0, Research, and Life Projects outputs. Benefits: Reduces cognitive load from 30+ lines to 10-12, prevents decision paralysis, makes next action crystal clear, keeps details available when needed. Addresses 'Post-Bootstrap Guidance Overload' pain point.",
