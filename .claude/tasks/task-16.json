  "notes": "Created comprehensive PHASE-0-PATTERN.md in repository root. Includes:\n1. Overview & problem statement - Why Phase 0 exists (prevent refactoring from late-discovered ambiguities)\n2. When to use Phase 0 - Decision criteria, indicators, domain-specific examples (regulatory, scientific, legal, financial, etc.)\n3. Four-step workflow - Visual diagram and detailed process (Analyze → Resolve → Generate → Initialize)\n4. Command structure templates - Complete templates for all 4 commands with domain adaptation examples\n5. Phase 0 artifacts reference - Detailed structure for 6 artifact types (ambiguity report, assumptions, glossary, data contracts, component manifest, dependency graph)\n6. Integration with task management - How tasks are generated from artifacts, automatic breakdown workflow\n7. Domain-specific adaptations - Examples for Power Query, Python, SQL, REST API, Legal/Contract\n8. ROI analysis - Time investment vs savings (88% reduction), break-even at 10 ambiguities\n9. Best practices & troubleshooting - Common issues and solutions\nTotal: 900+ lines. Reusable pattern applicable across all template types."
