Adapt the command for the lite/ template by removing complex features not applicable to the minimal setup (workflow diagram checks, semantic validation for 20+ tasks). Keep core functionality: task JSON schema validation, relationship integrity, ID safety, overview consistency, status rules, difficulty ranges, and basic CLAUDE.md audit.",
