  "description": "Restore the health-check command from .archive/examples/development-project/.claude/commands/health-check.md and enhance it with GitHub repository comparison functionality. The enhanced command should be able to compare a local project's .claude/ structure against this template repository to identify drift and missing updates. This requires the version tracking system (Task 2) and sync manifest (Task 3) to be in place first.",
