  "description": "Restore the health-check command from .archive/examples/development-project/.claude/commands/health-check.md and enhance it with GitHub repository comparison functionality. The enhanced command should be able to compare a local project's .claude/ structure against this template repository to identify drift and missing updates. This requires the version tracking system (Task 2) and sync manifest (Task 3) to be in place first.",

Features: (1) Task system validation - schema, relationships, ID safety, overview consistency, status rules, difficulty ranges; (2) CLAUDE.md audit - line counts, section sizes, code block lengths; (3) Template sync check - compares local files against GitHub repo using gh CLI, version drift detection, update instructions. Standard version includes additional semantic validation for 20+ task projects. Both updated CLAUDE.md to list /health-check command. Edge cases documented.",

Edge cases documented to ensure robust behavior."
