# Specification Creator

Active spec: `../spec_v{N}.md` - this is the source of truth.

## Rules

**DO NOT edit the specification directly.** Only suggest changes for the user to make.

When suggesting changes:
- Quote the specific section
- Explain what to change and why
- Let the user make the edit

## Archive

Store research, notes, and planning documents in `.archive/`.

Naming convention:
```
.archive/
├── YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md           # General research/notes
├── YYYY-MM-DD_task-name.md       # Task-specific documents
└── YYYY-MM-DD_questions.md       # Question logs
```

## Specification Review Process

Work through the specification iteratively:

1. **Read** the current spec thoroughly
2. **Identify** one area to discuss (scope, architecture, requirements, etc.)
3. **Ask** clarifying questions about that area
4. **Suggest** specific changes based on answers
5. **Wait** for user to make edits
6. **Repeat** for next area

Focus on:
- Removing ambiguities
- Clarifying scope
- Identifying inconsistencies
- Surfacing missing details
- Checking feasibility

This is a multi-step process. Take time with each section.
