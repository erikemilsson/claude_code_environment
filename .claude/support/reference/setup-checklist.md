# Setup Checklist

> **Read during decomposition.** `/work` runs these checks as the first step when decomposing a spec into tasks. Runs every decomposition but is most useful on the first one — subsequent decompositions (e.g., after a spec version bump) will typically pass all checks. Advisory only — warnings do not block decomposition.

## Checks

### 1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Customization

Look for unfilled template placeholders:
- `[bracketed text]` — unfilled placeholders (e.g., `[Brief description]`, `[Your license here]`)
- `<!-- DELETE EVERYTHING` — template markers
- `## Maintaining This Template` — template-specific section

✓ Pass: No placeholders found
⚠ Warn: Placeholders remain — list which ones

### 2. Project Layout Check

Verify the project uses flat layout (app at repo root, recommended since template v2.0):

- Check for `package.json` (or equivalent project manifest) at the repo root
- Check that no `app/` subdirectory contains a separate `package.json` (subdirectory layout)

✓ Pass: App files at repo root (flat layout)
⚠ Warn: App appears to be in a subdirectory — see `.claude/support/reference/known-issues.md` KI-001 for potential framework tooling issues. The template works in both layouts, but flat layout avoids dev server and build tool friction.

### 3. `version.json` Configuration

Check that `.claude/version.json` exists and has a `template_repo` field pointing to the upstream template repository:
```json
{
  "template_repo": "https://github.com/TEMPLATE-OWNER/TEMPLATE-REPO"
}
```

This is the source repo for template sync (`/health-check` Part 5). It should point to the template origin, not the user's project repo.

✓ Pass: File exists with a `template_repo` value
⚠ Warn: File missing or `template_repo` is empty

## Output

Report results inline during decomposition as a brief summary block:

```
Setup check:
  ✓ CLAUDE.md customized
  ⚠ version.json — file missing
```

Continue with decomposition regardless of warnings.

## Optional Hooks

Hooks let you enforce structural rules at the harness level — running before or after every tool call. They live in `.claude/settings.local.json` (user-owned, gitignored) under the `hooks` key, so they're opt-in per project. The template does not ship hooks; the recipe below is documentation for users who want a copy-paste starting point.

### Block dev-server starts (frontend projects)

Long-running dev servers (`next dev`, `npm run dev`, etc.) are easy to start accidentally inside an agent loop and hard to terminate cleanly afterwards. A `PreToolUse` hook can hard-block them so you start the dev server yourself in a separate terminal.

Add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.command // \"\"' | grep -qE '(npm|pnpm|yarn|bun)( run)? dev|next dev|vite( |$)' && { echo 'Dev server start blocked by PreToolUse hook in settings.local.json. Start it yourself in another terminal if needed.' >&2; exit 2; } || exit 0"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- `PreToolUse` fires before every Bash invocation; the JSON tool envelope (including `tool_input.command`) is piped to the hook on stdin.
- `jq` extracts the command string; `grep -qE` returns 0 if any dev-server pattern matches.
- On match: print to stderr and exit 2 — Claude Code treats exit 2 as a hard block and surfaces the message to the model. On no match: exit 0 and the Bash call proceeds.
- Requires `jq` on `PATH` (preinstalled on most Linux distros; `brew install jq` on macOS).

**Composition with `permissions.allow` and auto mode:**
- Hooks run **after** rule lookup and classifier evaluation — they're the final gate before execution. A `PreToolUse` hook can hard-block a command that `permissions.allow` or `--permission-mode auto` would otherwise approve.
- A `permissions.deny` rule short-circuits before the hook ever runs. Use `deny` for static blocks; use a hook when the decision needs runtime logic (parsing the actual command string, checking env vars, inspecting working-directory state).

**Customizing:**
- Adjust the regex to cover the package manager / framework / script names your project uses.
- For multi-pattern logic or several projects, lift the inline command into a script file (e.g., `scripts/hooks/block-dev-server.sh`) and reference its path in the `command` field — keeps `settings.local.json` readable.
- Other useful matchers: `Write` / `Edit` (guard specific paths), `WebFetch` (block external endpoints), or `*` (run for every tool).

See Claude Code's hooks documentation for the full event list (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, etc.) and matcher syntax.
