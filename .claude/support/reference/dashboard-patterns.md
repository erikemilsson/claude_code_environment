# Dashboard Patterns

Canonical dashboard structure and patterns. This file is the single source of truth for section headings, emojis, and ordering. Both dashboard regeneration (`/work`) and validation (`/health-check`) reference this file.

---

## Canonical Dashboard Template

The dashboard **must** contain these sections in this exact order. Section headings (including emojis) are fixed — do not vary them.

### Header Line

Below the `# Dashboard` title, include:
```
*Regenerated by `/work` after task changes. May be stale if tasks were modified outside `/work`.*
```

### Section Definitions

| # | Heading | Emoji | Purpose |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `# Dashboard` | — | Title (followed by header line above) |
| 2 | `## Project Context` | — | Project metadata table (name, stage, start date) |
| 3 | `## 🚨 Needs Your Attention` | 🚨 | Consolidated attention: decisions pending, human tasks, reviews |
| 4 | `## Quick Status` | — | Overall completion %, summary counts by owner |
| 5 | `## 🛤️ Critical Path` | 🛤️ | Dependency chain to completion with owner indicators |
| 6 | `## 🤖 Claude Status` | 🤖 | In Progress / Ready to Start / Blocked for Claude tasks |
| 7 | `## 📊 Progress This Week` | 📊 | Completed/Started/Created counts, recently completed list |
| 8 | `## 📋 All Decisions` | 📋 | Decision log table |
| 9 | `## 📝 All Tasks` | 📝 | Full task table with summary line |
| 10 | `## 💡 Notes & Ideas` | 💡 | User-preserved section between `<!-- USER SECTION -->` markers |

### Section Toggle Configuration

Users can control which sections Claude builds by adding a `dashboard_sections` block to the spec frontmatter or to a `dashboard-config` section in CLAUDE.md:

```yaml
# In spec frontmatter or CLAUDE.md
dashboard_sections:
  project_context: build        # actively create/update
  needs_attention: build
  quick_status: build
  critical_path: build
  claude_status: build
  progress: build
  all_decisions: maintain       # preserve existing, minor updates only
  all_tasks: build
  notes: preserve               # always preserved (never overwritten)
```

**Modes:**
| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `build` | Actively generate from source data on every regeneration (default) |
| `maintain` | Keep existing content, only update if data changes significantly |
| `exclude` | Skip this section entirely during regeneration |
| `preserve` | Never modify (Notes & Ideas always uses this) |

**Default:** If no configuration exists, all sections default to `build`.

**Where to configure:** Add `dashboard_sections` to the YAML frontmatter in `spec_v{N}.md`, or add a `## Dashboard Configuration` section in CLAUDE.md with the toggles. The spec frontmatter takes precedence.

### Regeneration Rules

When regenerating the dashboard:
1. **Read all `task-*.json` files** — tasks are the source of truth, not the previous dashboard
2. **Read all `decision-*.md` files** — decisions are the source of truth
3. **Preserve the Notes & Ideas section** — content between `<!-- USER SECTION -->` and `<!-- END USER SECTION -->` markers must be kept verbatim
4. **Use the exact headings above** — no emoji substitution, no heading rewording
5. **Separate sections with `---`** horizontal rules

### Sub-Section Structure

**Needs Your Attention** has three sub-sections:
- `### Decisions Pending` — table: ID, Decision, Category, Priority, Blocking?
- `### Tasks Ready for You` — table: ID, Task, Type, Due
- `### Reviews & Approvals` — table: Item, Type, Context

**Claude Status** has three sub-sections:
- `### In Progress` — current task
- `### Ready to Start` — next available Claude tasks
- `### Blocked` — Claude tasks blocked by dependencies or decisions

### Table Formats

**Project Context:**
```
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Project** | [name] |
| **Stage** | [phase] |
| **Started** | [date] |
```

**Quick Status:**
```
**Overall: N% complete** (X of Y tasks)

| Total | Done | ❗ You | 🤖 Claude | 👥 Both | Blocked |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
```

**All Tasks:**
```
| ID | Title | Status | Diff | Owner | Due | Deps |
|----|-------|--------|------|-------|-----|------|
```
- Out-of-spec tasks: prefix title with ⚠️
- Summary line: `*Summary: X/Y complete (N%)*`

**All Decisions:**
```
| ID | Title | Category | Status | Decided |
|----|-------|----------|--------|---------|
```

### Empty State Placeholders

When a section has no data, use italic placeholder text:
- `*No pending decisions*`
- `*No human tasks ready*`
- `*Nothing to review*`
- `*No tasks in progress*`
- `*No Claude tasks ready*`
- `*No Claude tasks blocked*`
- `*No recent completions*`
- `*No decisions yet*`
- `*No tasks yet*`
- `*No tasks defined yet*`

## Review Item Lifecycle

Items in the **Needs Your Attention → Reviews & Approvals** section follow a defined lifecycle.

### What Creates Review Items

| Source | Item | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| verify-agent | Out-of-spec task recommendations | "Add unit tests for CI" needing Accept/Reject/Defer |
| `/work` | Phase boundary approvals | "Implementation complete. Ready to verify?" |
| `/work` | Spec drift detected | "2 sections changed, 4 tasks affected" |
| implement-agent | Decision needing user input | Decision record created, awaiting approval |
| Questions system | Blocking questions | `[BLOCKING]` question in questions.md |

### When Items Are Resolved

| Item Type | Resolved When |
|-----------|---------------|
| Out-of-spec recommendations | User selects Accept/Reject/Defer for each |
| Phase boundary approvals | User confirms transition |
| Spec drift notifications | User processes reconciliation UI |
| Pending decisions | Decision status changes from `draft`/`proposed` to `approved`/`implemented` |
| Blocking questions | Question moved to Answered table in questions.md |

### Dashboard Regeneration Rules

Review items are **derived, not stored**. During regeneration:

1. **Scan for unresolved items** — check task files for `out_of_spec: true` without `out_of_spec_approved`, check decision files for `draft`/`proposed` status, check questions.md for unresolved blocking questions
2. **Populate the Reviews & Approvals table** from current data
3. **Never carry forward stale entries** — if the underlying data is resolved, the item disappears on next regeneration
4. **No dangling references** — every review item must link to a concrete file (task JSON, decision MD, or questions.md entry). Never write "see findings below" without the actual content.

### Preventing Staleness

Since the dashboard is regenerated from source files, review items automatically clear when:
- A task is deleted or approved → removed from next regeneration
- A decision is approved → no longer appears as pending
- A question is answered → no longer appears as blocking

No manual cleanup is needed.

## Domain-Specific Sub-Dashboards

*Added: 2026-01-27*

**Context:** When a project has a complex domain area that needs dedicated tracking beyond the main task list - such as workshop management, inventory tracking, customer pipelines, or experiment logs.

**Pattern:** Create a separate markdown file in `.claude/support/` for domain-specific tracking, then link to it from the main dashboard's Notes section.

**Structure:**
```markdown
# [Domain] Dashboard

*Last updated: [date]*

## [Key Metric 1]
| Column | Column | Column |
|--------|--------|--------|
| data   | data   | data   |

## [Key Metric 2]
...

## Quick Actions
- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2
```

**Example - Workshop Management:**
```markdown
# Workshop Management Dashboard

## Upcoming Sessions
| Date | Topic | Registered | Capacity | Status |
|------|-------|------------|----------|--------|
| 2026-02-15 | Intro to ML | 23 | 30 | Open |
| 2026-02-22 | Advanced NLP | 30 | 30 | Full |

## Materials Status
| Workshop | Slides | Exercises | Solutions |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Intro to ML | ✅ | ✅ | 🔄 |
| Advanced NLP | ✅ | ⏳ | ⏳ |

## Quick Actions
- [ ] Finalize ML solutions
- [ ] Create NLP exercises
```

**Why:** The main dashboard tracks tasks and project progress. Domain-specific dashboards track operational metrics unique to your project's subject matter. Separating them:
- Keeps the main dashboard focused on development progress
- Allows domain tracking to evolve independently
- Provides a single place to check domain-specific status

**When to use:**
- Project has operational concerns beyond code (events, inventory, experiments)
- You find yourself asking "what's the status of X" where X isn't a development task
- Multiple people need to track domain-specific metrics

**Linking from main dashboard:**
Add to the Notes & Ideas section:
```markdown
## 💡 Notes & Ideas

**Quick Links:**
- [Workshop Dashboard](support/workshop-dashboard.md)
- [Experiment Log](support/experiment-log.md)

## Critical Path Clarity

*Added: 2026-01-27*

**Context:** When multiple people (or Claude and human) are working on a project and need to know what's blocking progress.

**Pattern:** The Critical Path section shows the sequence of dependent tasks that must complete for the project to finish. Each step indicates who owns it, making handoff points clear.

**Reading the critical path:**
- ❗ **You**: Human action required - Claude is waiting
- 🤖 **Claude**: Claude can proceed - human doesn't need to act
- 👥 **Both**: Collaborative task - coordinate timing

**Example:**
```markdown
## 🛤️ Critical Path

**Next steps to completion:**

1. ❗ **You**: Review API design doc - *blocks step 2*
2. 🤖 **Claude**: Implement API endpoints - *blocks step 3*
3. 👥 **Both**: Integration testing
4. ❗ **You**: Production deployment approval

*4 steps remaining on critical path*
```

**Why:** Without this view, it's easy to lose track of what's actually blocking progress vs. what's parallel work that can wait.
