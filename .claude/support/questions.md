## Workflow

**Who adds questions:** Claude adds questions during `/work` when blocked or uncertain about requirements, approach, or scope.

**When reviewed:** At phase boundaries, when explicitly prompted, or when blocking questions prevent progress.

**Format:** Each question is prefixed with its date: `- [2026-01-15] Question text`. Add `[BLOCKING]` after the date for blocking questions: `- [2026-01-15] [BLOCKING] Question text`.

**Answering:** Move answered questions to the "Answered Questions" table below with the date. Keep for reference.

**Staleness:** Questions older than 14 days trigger a warning in `/health-check`. The date prefix enables this check.
