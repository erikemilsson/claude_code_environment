**Who adds questions:** Claude adds questions during `/work` when blocked or uncertain about requirements, approach, or scope.

**When reviewed:** At phase boundaries, when explicitly prompted, or when blocking questions prevent progress.

**Marking urgency:** Prefix blocking questions with `[BLOCKING]` to indicate they prevent phase completion.

**Answering:** Move answered questions to the "Answered Questions" table below with the date. Keep for reference.

**Staleness:** Questions older than 14 days trigger a warning in `/health-check`.
