# Questions

Questions that need human input during the project workflow.

## How It Works

- Claude adds questions to `questions.md` when blocked or uncertain during `/work`
- Questions are categorized: Requirements, Technical, Scope, Dependencies
- `[BLOCKING]` questions halt work until answered
- Questions older than 14 days trigger a `/health-check` warning

## Files

- `questions.md` — Active questions and answered archive
