## 🚨 Needs Your Attention

Everything Claude needs from you — with links to the relevant files and a way to respond.

### Verification Debt

✅ No verification debt

<!-- Debt format when debt > 0:
⛔ **Verification Debt: N tasks** — Project cannot complete until resolved
| Task | Title | Issue |
|------|-------|-------|
Debt includes: "Awaiting Verification", "Finished" without task_verification,
or task_verification.result == "fail". Out-of-spec tasks excluded.
End with: *Run `/work` to trigger verification for these tasks.* -->

### Decisions Pending

*No pending decisions*

<!-- Format when decisions exist:
| ID | Decision | Question | Options Doc |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|
| D-001 | Auth strategy | OAuth vs JWT? | [decision-001.md](../support/decisions/decision-001.md) |
End with: *Open the decision doc, review options, and check your selection.* -->

### Tasks Ready for You

*No human tasks ready*

<!-- Format when human tasks exist:
| ID | Task | Action | Link |
|----|------|--------|------|
| 7 | Configure API keys | Add keys to `.env` and check off | [.env.example](../../.env.example) |
For tasks needing feedback, add below the table:
**Task N — Feedback:**
\<!-- Write your feedback here, then run /work complete N --\>
Rules: every task has Action (what to DO) and Link (to relevant file). -->

### Reviews & Approvals

*Nothing to review*

<!-- Format when reviews exist:
- [ ] **Item** — What to do → [link to file](path)
Rules: always include link when action involves a file, say what user should DO,
provide feedback area or completion signal, keep descriptions short. -->
