## 🚨 Action Required

*Nothing needs your attention right now.*

<!-- RENDERING RULES
Only show sub-headings that have content. Empty categories are OMITTED
entirely — no "✅ None" or "*Nothing*" placeholder lines.

### Verification Debt
Show when: task in "Awaiting Verification", or "Finished" without task_verification,
or task_verification.result == "fail". Exclude out-of-spec tasks.

⛔ **Verification debt: N tasks** — must resolve before completion

| Task | Title | Issue |
|------|-------|-------|

*Run `/work` to trigger verification.*

### Decisions
Show when: any decision-*.md has no checked box in "Select an Option".

| Decision | Question | Doc |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Auth strategy | OAuth vs JWT? | [decision-001.md](../support/decisions/decision-001.md) |

*Open the doc, review options, check your selection, then run `/work`.*

### Your Tasks
Show when: human-owned tasks with status "Pending" and all deps satisfied.
Every row MUST have: what to DO (not just what the task IS), and a link to the relevant file.

| Task | What To Do | Where |
|------|------------|-------|
| 7 · Configure API keys | Add keys to `.env` and confirm | [.env.example](../../.env.example) |

For tasks needing feedback, add below the table:
**Task N — Feedback:**
\<!-- Write your feedback here, then run /work complete N --\>

### Reviews
Show when: out_of_spec tasks without approval, blocking questions in questions.md,
or draft/proposed decision docs needing review.

- [ ] **Item** — what to do → [link to file](path)

### Spec Drift
Show when: drift-deferrals.json has entries, or section fingerprints differ from tasks.

⚠️ **N sections changed** since decomposition (M tasks affected)
*Run `/work` to reconcile.*

## 🤖 Claude

*Idle — no tasks assigned*

<!-- Format when tasks exist (compact — one line per state):

**Working on:** Task 3 "Add auth middleware"
**Up next:** Task 4 "Create API routes", Task 6 "Add validation" (parallel-eligible)
**Blocked:** Task 7 → DEC-001 · Task 8 → Phase 2

When parallel batch is active:
**Working on (parallel):**
| Task | Title | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
**Up next:** ...
**Blocked:** ...

Omit any line that would be empty (e.g., no "**Blocked:** *None*"). -->

## 📊 Progress

*No tasks yet — run `/work` to decompose the spec.*

<!-- Format when tasks exist:

| Phase | Done | Total | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 1. Data Pipeline | 4 | 6 | 🔄 Active |
| 2. API Layer | 0 | 4 | ⏳ Blocked (DEC-001) |
| 3. Frontend | 0 | 3 | ⏳ Waiting on Phase 2 |

**Critical path:** ❗ Resolve DEC-001 → 🤖 Build API layer → 🤖 Phase verification → Done *(3 steps)*

**This week:** 3 completed · 1 started · 2 created

Rules:
- Phase table always shows ALL phases (including blocked/future)
- Critical path is a single line: owner-tagged steps joined by →
  Owners: ❗ (human), 🤖 (Claude), 👥 (both)
  For complex paths (>5 steps), show first 3 + "... N more → Done"
- "This week" counts tasks by status change within last 7 days
- Omit "This week" line if all counts are zero
