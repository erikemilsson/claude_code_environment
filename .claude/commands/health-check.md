# Health Check

Combined system health check for tasks, decisions, instruction files, rules, and template sync.

## Usage
```
/health-check                    # Run all checks, offer fixes
/health-check --report           # Show issues only, no fix prompts
```

## Purpose

Manual maintenance tool that validates tasks, decisions, instruction files (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `./CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`), and template sync. Operational checks for `/work` are defined inline in `work.md`.

---

## Part 1: Task System Validation

Detects and fixes drift from task management standards.

### Validation Checks

#### 1. Task JSON Schema Validation

Validates required fields (id, title, status, difficulty) and optional fields per `.claude/support/reference/task-schema.md`. Boolean fields (`parallel_safe`, `out_of_spec`, `out_of_spec_rejected`, `cross_phase`, `user_review_pending`) must be booleans when present — flag non-boolean values as schema violations.

**Migration detection:** When non-conforming schemas are found (missing required fields, unknown status values, unexpected fields), provide migration guidance:
- Suggest field mappings (e.g., `"done"` → `"Finished"`, `"assignee"` → `"owner"`)
- List specific remediation steps per task
- Never auto-migrate — report issues and let the user decide

#### 2. Relationship Integrity

**Parent-subtask consistency:**
- If task has `parent_task`, parent must exist and list this task in `subtasks`
- If task has `subtasks`, each subtask must exist and reference this task as `parent_task`
- `"Broken Down"` status requires non-empty `subtasks` array
- Subtasks should not have `"Broken Down"` as status (only top-level)

**Dependency validity:**
- All task IDs in `dependencies` array must exist
- No circular dependencies

**Absorbed reference validity:**
- If task has `absorbed_into`, the referenced task ID must exist and must not itself be Absorbed (no absorption chains)

#### 3. ID Safety (Breakdown Protection)

When breaking down tasks, IDs must not collide:
- Subtask IDs use format `{parent_id}_{n}` (e.g., `5_1`, `5_2`, `5_3`)
- Check for ID uniqueness across all task files
- Verify no orphaned task files exist

#### 4. Dashboard Consistency

**Row matching:**
- Every task JSON has a corresponding row in dashboard
- Every row in dashboard has a corresponding task JSON
- Status, title, and difficulty match between JSON and dashboard
- Summary count is accurate

**Structure validation:**
- Required sections exist: `# Dashboard`, `## 🚨 Action Required`, `## 📊 Progress`, `## 📋 Tasks`, `## 📋 Decisions`, `## 💡 Notes`
- Sections in correct order
- Sections with unchecked toggles in the section toggle checklist are allowed to be missing
- Optional section (`## 👁️ Custom Views`) may appear between Decisions and Notes when toggled on

If dashboard content or structure is inconsistent, the fix is always: regenerate.

#### 4b. Dashboard State Sidecar

- `.claude/dashboard-state.json` should exist if dashboard.md exists
- If missing: WARNING — "Dashboard state sidecar missing. Next dashboard regeneration will create it."
- If present: validate JSON structure (required keys: user_notes, section_toggles, phase_gates, inline_feedback, custom_views_instructions, updated)
- Cross-reference: section_toggles should match the dashboard's SECTION TOGGLES checklist
- Cross-reference: phase_gates entries should match PHASE GATE markers in dashboard

#### 5. Status Rules

| Status | Rules |
|--------|-------|
| `Pending` | No special requirements |
| `In Progress` | Multiple allowed only when parallel-eligible: `files_affected` don't overlap, all deps satisfied, within `max_parallel_tasks` limit. **ERROR** if parallel conditions violated. |
| `Awaiting Verification` | Transitional only — must proceed to verification immediately. Auto-recovered by `/work` Step 0. |
| `Blocked` | Should have `notes` explaining the blocker |
| `On Hold` | Should have `notes` explaining why paused. Not auto-routed by `/work`. Warning if on hold > 30 days. |
| `Absorbed` | Must have `absorbed_into` field referencing a valid task ID that exists. |
| `Broken Down` | Must have non-empty `subtasks` array |
| `Finished` | MUST have `task_verification.result` of "pass". If has subtasks, all subtasks must also be `Finished` |

#### 6. Difficulty Range

- Must be integer 1-10
- Tasks with difficulty >= 7 should be `"Broken Down"` or have subtasks
- Subtasks should have difficulty <= 6

#### 7. Workflow Compliance

Detects tasks that may have bypassed the implement-agent or verify-agent workflows.

**Verification debt (ERRORS):**
- Finished tasks MUST have a `task_verification` field with `result` of `"pass"`
- `task_verification.checks` should have all 7 keys (`files_exist`, `consistency_check`, `spec_alignment`, `output_quality`, `runtime_validation`, `integration_ready`, `scope_validation`) with pass/fail values (or `"skipped"` only when result is `"fail"` due to timeout). Note: `runtime_validation` additionally allows `"not_applicable"` and `"partial"` as valid non-error values. **Exceptions:** (a) tasks with `owner: "human"` that have `checks.self_attested: "pass"` are exempt — human tasks use self-attestation instead of the standard checks. (b) Parent tasks (status `"Broken Down"` with non-empty `subtasks`, OR `"Finished"` with non-empty `subtasks` where every subtask is itself `"Finished"` with passing per-task verification) that have `checks.aggregate_subtask_verification: "pass"` are exempt — verification aggregates from subtasks (per FB-074).
- If any check is `"fail"`, the overall `result` must also be `"fail"` — a check-level fail with a result-level pass is invalid
- If any finished task lacks `task_verification`: **ERROR** — "Verification debt: N finished tasks missing verification"
- If any finished task has `task_verification.result == "fail"`: **ERROR**

**Verification debt calculation:**
```
verification_debt = count of tasks where:
  - status == "Finished" AND (
    - task_verification does not exist, OR
    - task_verification.result == "fail", OR
    - task_verification.result != "pass"
  )
```

**Workflow bypass detection (warnings):**
- Finished tasks with empty `notes` (possible skipped self-review)
- Tasks that appear to have jumped from `"Pending"` to `"Finished"` without passing through `"In Progress"` and `"Awaiting Verification"`

**Completion gate checks (ERRORS):**
- If dashboard shows "Project Complete" or "100%" completion:
  - `.claude/verification-result.json` MUST exist with `result` of "pass"
  - ALL finished tasks MUST have passing `task_verification`
  - If either condition fails: ERROR — "Project marked complete without verification"
- Check for status mismatch: spec says "active" but dashboard shows "Complete" (or vice versa)

**Note:** Workflow bypass warnings are informational. Some tasks may legitimately have brief notes. The intent is to surface patterns, not block individual tasks.

**Script alternative:** `.claude/scripts/validate-tasks.py .claude/tasks` runs schema + verification-debt checks deterministically and prints a combined report. `--json` flag emits structured output for downstream consumption.

#### 8. Workspace Staleness

**Stale Workspace Files:**
- Files in `.claude/support/workspace/` older than 30 days
- Warning: "N workspace files are over 30 days old"

#### 9. Out-of-Spec Task Tracking

Reports tasks with `"out_of_spec": true` in a separate section of the report. Informational — out-of-spec tasks are valid but won't be verified against spec acceptance criteria.

#### 10. Dashboard Staleness

**Task state hash check:**
1. Compute: `SHA-256(sorted list of task_id + ":" + status + ":" + difficulty + ":" + owner)`
2. Read dashboard metadata block (if exists)
3. Compare hashes — if different, dashboard is stale

**Format staleness check:**
1. Read `template_version` from dashboard `<!-- DASHBOARD META -->` block
2. Read `template_version` from `.claude/version.json`
3. If they differ (or META field is absent), dashboard is format-stale
4. Report: "Dashboard generated with template {old} but current template is {new} — regenerate to apply format updates"

A dashboard can be content-stale (task hash mismatch), format-stale (template_version mismatch), or both. Either condition triggers regeneration in auto-fix.

**Stale "In Progress" tasks:**
- Tasks with status `"In Progress"` where `updated_date` (or `created_date`) is > 7 days old
- Indicates abandoned work or forgotten state updates

#### 11. Provenance Integrity

**Snapshot file existence:**
- For each task with `section_snapshot_ref`, verify the referenced file exists at `.claude/support/previous_specifications/{section_snapshot_ref}`
- Missing snapshot: WARNING — "Task {id} references snapshot `{ref}` which does not exist. Drift detection will fall back to full-spec comparison."

**Decision dependency format:**
- For each task with `decision_dependencies`, verify each entry matches pattern `DEC-\d+`
- Invalid format: ERROR — "Task {id} has malformed decision dependency `{value}`"

### Task Auto-Fixes

| Issue | Auto-Fix |
|-------|----------|
| Dashboard inconsistent or structurally invalid | Regenerate dashboard.md |
| Dashboard stale (hash mismatch, format staleness, or missing metadata) | Regenerate dashboard.md with fresh metadata |
| Parent missing subtask in array | Add subtask ID to parent's subtasks array |
| Subtask missing parent_task field | Add parent_task field |
| "Broken Down" with empty subtasks | Change status to "Pending" |
| All subtasks Finished or Absorbed but parent not | Set parent status to "Finished" |
| Missing created_date | Add current date |
| Multiple "In Progress" (parallel-ineligible) | Check eligibility — if files overlap or deps unsatisfied, ask which to keep |
| Nested `.claude/.claude/` directory | Flag as error, recommend deletion |
| Orphan dependency reference | Remove invalid dependency ID from array |
| Stale "In Progress" (> 7 days) | Ask user: mark Pending, On Hold, Blocked, or keep |
| Stale "On Hold" (> 30 days) | Ask user: resume, absorb, or keep |
| Absorbed without `absorbed_into` | Ask user: provide absorbing task ID, or change status |
| Absorbed referencing non-existent task | Ask user: provide valid task ID, or change status |
| Absorbed referencing another Absorbed task (chain) | Suggest the non-Absorbed end of the chain; ask user to confirm or change |
| Missing snapshot file | Informational only — drift detection degrades gracefully |
| Malformed decision dependency format | Ask user: correct or remove the entry |
| Stale workspace files (> 30 days) | List files, ask user: graduate to final location, or delete |
| Dashboard state sidecar missing | Create from current dashboard markers (or defaults if markers broken) |
| Sidecar/dashboard toggle mismatch | Update sidecar from dashboard markers (dashboard is more recent) |
| Stale "Awaiting Verification" (> 1 hour) | Auto-recovered by `/work` Step 0 on next run. If running standalone: trigger verify-agent immediately for task |

### Non-Fixable Issues (Manual Required)

| Issue | Why Manual |
|-------|------------|
| Missing required field (id, title, status, difficulty) | Need human input for values |
| Invalid JSON syntax | Need to examine file |
| Circular dependencies | Need to understand intent |
| Duplicate task IDs | Need to decide which to keep |
| Unknown status value | Need to determine correct status (valid: Pending, In Progress, Awaiting Verification, Blocked, On Hold, Absorbed, Broken Down, Finished) |

## Part 2: Instruction Files Audit

Two separate checks: environment CLAUDE.md template alignment, and project root CLAUDE.md bloat detection.

### Part 2a: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Template Alignment

`.claude/CLAUDE.md` is template-owned and should not be modified by users. This check compares the local file against the template version.

**Process:**
1. If template remote is configured (Part 5), diff `.claude/CLAUDE.md` against `template/{default_branch}:.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. If no template remote, compare against a known hash stored in `.claude/version.json` (field: `claude_md_hash`)
3. If the file has been modified locally, present the deviations and ask the user:
   - **Revert** — restore template version
   - **Keep** — acknowledge deviation (record in `version.json` as `claude_md_override: true`)
   - **Merge** — show diff, let user decide line by line

**What to report:**
- ✓ if `.claude/CLAUDE.md` matches template
- ⚠️ if deviations found (with diff summary)
- ℹ️ if template remote not configured (skip check)

### Part 2b: Root `./CLAUDE.md` Audit

The root `./CLAUDE.md` contains project-specific instructions and is user-owned.

#### Missing File Detection

If `./CLAUDE.md` does not exist at the project root:
1. Report: ℹ️ "No root CLAUDE.md found — this file holds project-specific instructions for Claude"
2. Offer to create one from the template at `.claude/support/reference/root-claude-md-template.md`
3. If the user accepts, copy the template to `./CLAUDE.md`
4. If the user declines, note as informational and continue

#### Bloat Thresholds

| Metric | Warning (soft limit) | Error (hard limit) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Total lines | 100 | 200 |
| Section lines | 15 | 25 |
| Code blocks | 10 | 20 |
| Inline schemas | 8 | Always flag |

#### Audit Checks

1. **Total lines** — compare against soft/hard limits
2. **Section sizes** — check each `##` section for line count
3. **Code blocks** — check each code block for length
4. **Inline schemas** — flag JSON schemas >8 lines
5. **Reference validation** — check that all file paths referenced in the root CLAUDE.md (links, `@` imports) actually exist and are in the correct location (`.claude/support/reference/` for extracted docs)

#### Condensation Guidance

When a section exceeds the soft limit, offer these options:

1. **Extract** — Move verbose content to `.claude/support/reference/project-{section-slug}.md`, replace with a link. Project reference docs use the `project-` prefix to distinguish from template-owned reference docs.
2. **Condense** — Rewrite to fewer lines. Apply the "would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?" test. Cut:
   - Standard conventions Claude already knows from reading code
   - Rules already enforced by linters or config files (eslintrc, prettier, tsconfig, etc.)
   - Detailed API docs (link instead)
   - Information that changes frequently
3. **Keep** — Mark as explicitly kept (acknowledge the size)
4. **Skip** — No changes

#### What Belongs Where

**Keep in root `./CLAUDE.md`:** Project overview (1-2 lines), tech stack, key build/test commands, naming conventions that differ from defaults, non-obvious gotchas.

**Extract to `.claude/support/reference/project-*.md`:** Detailed architecture docs, verbose code examples, API specifications, database schemas, deployment procedures.

**Don't put in root `./CLAUDE.md`:** Environment workflow instructions (those are in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/`), information Claude can infer from reading code, style rules already enforced by tooling.

### Part 2c: Rules Files Validation

Validates that the expected template rule files exist in `.claude/rules/`.

**Expected files:** `task-management.md`, `spec-workflow.md`, `decisions.md`, `dashboard.md`, `agents.md`, `archiving.md`, `session-management.md`, `feature-retirement.md`

**Checks:**
- Each expected file exists
- No expected file exceeds 220 lines (raised from 200 per FB-074 — accommodates genuinely rich procedures such as `feature-retirement.md`)
- User-created rule files (`project-*.md`) are noted as informational

---

### Part 2d: Capability Doc Freshness (DEC-017)

Validates that `.claude/support/reference/claude-code-authoring.md` has been verified against Claude Code docs within the staleness threshold.

**Procedure:**

1. Check if `.claude/support/reference/claude-code-authoring.md` exists. If not present, skip Part 2d silently (the doc is shipped with template v4.9.0; older template versions don't have it).
2. Read the footer line at end of file. Expected format:
   ```
   <!-- Last verified against Claude Code docs: <URL> @ <YYYY-MM-DD>; against template_version: <X.Y.Z> -->
   ```
3. Parse the date from the footer. If parsing fails (malformed footer, missing comment), surface inline: `Part 2d: ⚠ claude-code-authoring.md footer missing or malformed. Update with: 'Last verified against Claude Code docs: <URL> @ YYYY-MM-DD; against template_version: <X.Y.Z>'`.
4. Compute days since verification date:
   ```
   days_stale = (today - parsed_date).days
   ```
5. Apply threshold:
   - If `days_stale <= 90`: silent (pass)
   - If `90 < days_stale <= 180`: surface inline `Part 2d: ⚠ Capability doc not verified in {days_stale} days (threshold: 90). Consider verifying against Claude Code docs.`
   - If `days_stale > 180`: surface inline `Part 2d: ⚠⚠ Capability doc not verified in {days_stale} days (threshold: 90, hard threshold: 180). Strongly recommended to verify before authoring spec/skill/agent content that references Claude Code primitives.`
6. Regardless of staleness, offer the verification action:
   ```
   Actions: [V] Verify against current docs | [S] Skip | [D] Defer (suppress warning until next sync)
   ```
7. If user selects `[V]`:
   - WebFetch the docs URL from the footer
   - Diff the fetched content against the current doc body section by section
   - Present each diff as `[A] Accept change | [R] Reject (keep current) | [S] Skip section`
   - On any accept, update the doc body for that section
   - After all sections processed, update the footer date to today + `template_version` from `.claude/version.json`
8. If user selects `[S]`: leave doc unchanged, leave footer unchanged.
9. If user selects `[D]`: write a sentinel in `.claude/dashboard-state.json` (`capability_doc_defer_until: YYYY-MM-DD`, 30 days from today) to suppress the Part 2d warning until that date. Next `/health-check` after the defer-until date will surface the warning again.

**Why this matters:** the capability doc encodes load-bearing facts about Claude Code (turn-scoped `model:` / `effort:`, subagent isolation, MCP constraints, Agent tool model granularity, skill content lifecycle). These facts evolve as Claude Code ships features. The footer + lens combination keeps the reference doc honest without silent auto-sync (which would risk silent contradiction with current spec) and without requiring maintainer-driven version pinning (which decouples from Claude Code's release cadence). See DEC-017 for full rationale.

## Part 3: Decision System Validation

Validates the decision documentation system for schema compliance and consistency.

### Validation Checks

#### 1. Decision Record Schema

Each `decision-*.md` file must have valid frontmatter:

**Required fields:**
- `id` - Format: `DEC-NNN` (e.g., DEC-001, DEC-042). Must match `\d+` pattern after `DEC-`. The numeric portion must match the filename: `decision-{NNN}-*.md` → frontmatter `id: DEC-{NNN}`. Mismatch is an ERROR.
- `title` - Non-empty string
- `status` - One of: `draft`, `proposed`, `approved`, `implemented`, `superseded`
- `category` - One of: `architecture`, `technology`, `process`, `scope`, `methodology`, `vendor`, `ux`, `design`, `ui-ia`, `ui-content` (UI-side categories added per FB-074 — see `.claude/support/reference/decisions.md § Categories` for definitions)
- `created` - Valid date in YYYY-MM-DD format

**Optional fields:**
- `decided` - Date when decision was finalized
- `related.tasks` - Array of task IDs
- `related.decisions` - Array of decision IDs
- `spec_revised` - Boolean, set after `/iterate` processes an inflection point
- `spec_revised_date` - Date when spec was revised

#### 2. Dashboard Consistency

- Every decision file has a corresponding entry in the dashboard's Decisions table
- Every dashboard entry has a corresponding `decision-{NNN}-*.md` file
- Status in file frontmatter matches status in dashboard table

#### 3. Staleness Detection

- Decisions with status `draft` created > 30 days ago
- Decisions with status `proposed` created > 14 days ago without resolution

#### 4. Completeness (for approved/implemented)

Decisions with status `approved` or `implemented` must have:
- Non-empty Decision section (selected option and rationale)
- At least one option in the comparison table

#### 5. Implementation Anchor Validation

For decisions with status `implemented`:
- Must have non-empty `implementation_anchors` array
- Each anchor file path must exist in the project
- Report missing anchors as warnings

#### 6. Decision-Task Cross-Reference

Reports mismatches between decision `related.tasks` and task `decision_dependencies`:

**Decision → Task direction:**
- For each decision, check if referenced tasks have the decision ID in their `decision_dependencies`
- Report mismatches grouped by task status (Finished = most concerning, Pending = auto-fixable)

**Task → Decision direction:**
- For each task with `decision_dependencies`, verify each referenced `DEC-NNN` has a corresponding `decision-{NNN}-*.md` file
- Missing decision file: ERROR — "Task {id} references non-existent decision {DEC-NNN}"

This is a reporting check. The primary enforcement and interactive resolution happens in `/work` Step 2b.

### Decision Auto-Fixes

| Issue | Auto-Fix |
|-------|----------|
| File missing from dashboard | Add entry to dashboard's Decisions table |
| Dashboard entry missing file | Remove orphan entry from dashboard |
| Status mismatch | Ask user which is correct, update the other |
| Stale draft (> 30 days) | Ask user: delete, or set reminder |
| Stale proposed (> 14 days) | Ask user: approve, reject, or extend |
| Implemented without anchors | Ask user: add anchors, or revert to approved |
| Anchor file not found | Report for manual review |
| Cross-reference mismatch (Pending task) | Add decision ID to task's `decision_dependencies` |
| Cross-reference mismatch (other status) | Report for manual review |
| ID/filename mismatch | Ask user: rename file or update frontmatter ID |
| Task references non-existent decision | Ask user: remove dependency or create the decision record |

### Non-Fixable Issues (Manual Required)

| Issue | Why Manual |
|-------|------------|
| Invalid frontmatter syntax | Need to examine YAML |
| Invalid status/category/ID value | Need to determine correct value |
| Missing required field | Need human input |
| Incomplete approved decision | Need Decision section content |

---

## Part 4: Archive Validation

Validates spec archive consistency and detects misplaced files.

### Validation Checks

#### 1. Single-Spec Invariant

There must be exactly one `spec_v{N}.md` file in `.claude/`. Multiple spec files indicate a failed or incomplete version transition.

```
IF count == 0 → Info: "No spec file found" (valid for new projects)
IF count == 1 → ✓ Single-spec invariant holds
IF count > 1  → ERROR: "Multiple spec files found"
               Auto-fix: Archive lower versions to previous_specifications/
```

#### 2. Spec Version Continuity

For each version from 1 to N-1, check that `.claude/support/previous_specifications/spec_v{i}.md` exists.

#### 3. Misplaced Spec Files

Scan non-canonical locations for `spec_v*.md` files:
- `.claude/archive/`, `.claude/previous_specifications/`, `.archive/`, `.claude/specs/`, project root
- Report each with suggested correct path

#### 4. Decomposed Spec Validation

For archived specs where tasks reference that version, check if `spec_v{i}_decomposed.md` exists. Warning-level only.

### Archive Auto-Fixes

| Issue | Auto-Fix |
|-------|----------|
| Multiple spec files in `.claude/` | Archive lower versions, keep highest as current |
| Spec in wrong location | Move to `.claude/support/previous_specifications/` |
| Missing archived spec | Cannot auto-fix — warn user |
| Missing decomposed spec | Informational only |

---

## Part 5: Template Sync Check

Checks whether the project's `.claude/` workflow files are up to date with the template repository using git-based comparison. Skipped in the template repo (mirror of Parts 5d / 7: `system-overview.md` at project root indicates the template repo, where syncing the template against itself is self-referential and meaningless — `template_repo` points to the same URL as `origin`).

### Purpose

The upstream template may improve commands, agents, and reference docs. This check uses the template repo as a git remote to compare sync files and present updates.

### Repo-type skip

Before running any sync step: if `system-overview.md` exists at the project root, skip Part 5 entirely and report `ℹ️ Template sync skipped (template repo — self-sync is a no-op)`. The template repo's `version.json::template_repo` points to itself; adding a `template` remote pointing to the same URL as `origin` and diffing against it produces no useful output. The template's own work uses normal git workflow (push to origin); downstream-project sync flow does not apply.

### Requirements

- `.claude/version.json` — contains `template_repo` (git URL) and `template_version`
- `.claude/sync-manifest.json` — defines `sync` (updatable) vs `customize` (user-owned) vs `ignore` (project data) file categories
- `git` available (no `gh` CLI dependency)

### Sync State Sidecar

Per-file last-synced state lives in `.claude/.sync-state.json` (gitignored, in `ignore` category). The sidecar lets Part 5 distinguish two diff shapes that look identical to a naive `git diff`:

- **Template content not yet applied** — local is byte-for-byte identical to the last-synced state; the diff is pure template movement. Default action: APPLY.
- **Modified upstream** — local differs from the last-synced state (user edited it post-sync, or the file has never been synced). User adjudicates.

**Schema:**

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "last_full_sync_version": "<template_version at time of sync>",
  "last_full_sync_date": "<ISO 8601 date>",
  "files": {
    "<path>": { "synced_hash": "sha256:<full SHA-256 hex>" }
  }
}
```

**Hash format:** full SHA-256 hex with `sha256:` prefix. Aligns with `fingerprint.py`, `task_hash`, `spec_fingerprint`, dashboard META — one hash convention across the template. Computed over the file's raw bytes via `shasum -a 256 <path>` (macOS) or `sha256sum <path>` (Linux).

**Lifecycle:**
- **Read** in Step 2 to classify per-file diffs.
- **Written/updated** in Step 4 after each successful sync — only files the user actually accepted get their `synced_hash` recorded/refreshed. Files the user skipped retain their prior entry (or remain absent if never synced).
- **Missing entries** (file not in sidecar) fall through to "Modified upstream" — graceful migration for pre-3.15.0 projects without a sidecar, and for files newly added to the `sync` manifest that haven't been synced yet.

**First-run population:** the sidecar appears silently the first time Part 5 applies updates after 3.15.0 ships. No user-facing announcement. The file is gitignored (in `sync-manifest.json` `ignore` array), so it doesn't surface in `git status`.

**Recovery:** if the sidecar is deleted or corrupted, Part 5 falls through to current behavior on the next run. The next successful sync repopulates it from the post-checkout file hashes.

### Process

#### 1. Setup Remote

Ensure the template repo is configured as a git remote named `template`:

```
IF "template" remote doesn't exist → git remote add template {template_repo}
IF "template" remote exists but URL differs from version.json → warn, ask to update
```

Fetch latest: `git fetch template` (fetch only, never merge or pull).

If fetch fails (offline, invalid URL) → report as informational, skip remaining sync checks.

#### 2. Compare Sync Files

Determine the template's default branch via `git remote show template` (typically `main`). Read `.claude/.sync-state.json` (see "Sync State Sidecar" above) if present; absence triggers fallback (every diff classifies as "Modified upstream"). For each file matching `sync` category patterns in `sync-manifest.json`, use `git diff` to compare the local version against `template/{default_branch}:.claude/...`.

Per-file status:
- **Up to date** — no diff
- **Template content not yet applied** — template differs from local AND `local_hash == sidecar.files[path].synced_hash`. The local file is byte-for-byte identical to the last-synced state; the diff is pure template movement. Default action in Step 3: APPLY.
- **Modified upstream** — template differs from local AND (sidecar entry is missing OR `local_hash != sidecar.files[path].synced_hash`). Local was modified post-sync, or has never been synced. Default action in Step 3: present diff for user adjudication (Apply / Keep / Show diff).
- **New in template** — file exists upstream but not locally
- **Local only** — exists locally but not in template (kept, never flagged)

Never compare `customize` or `ignore` category files.

**Compute `local_hash`:** `shasum -a 256 <path>` (macOS) or `sha256sum <path>` (Linux); prefix `sha256:` to the bare hex. Compare string-equal against the sidecar's `synced_hash`. The hash is over raw bytes — line-ending differences DO produce different hashes (intentional: a CRLF/LF normalization at sync time is a real change, not a no-op).

#### 3. Present Changes

Group files by the per-file status from Step 2. Files classified as "Template content not yet applied" default to APPLY; "Modified upstream" entries default to user adjudication.

**Small changes** (few files, minor edits) — simple list with diff stats:

```
Template updates available (v1.5.0 → v1.6.0):

  Template content not yet applied (default: APPLY):
    .claude/support/reference/dashboard-regeneration.md (+12 -0 lines)

  Modified upstream (review before applying):
    .claude/commands/work.md (+15 -8 lines)

**Bigger changes** (structural, multi-file) — group related changes and explain impact:

```
Template updates available (v1.5.0 → v1.6.0):

1. Verification workflow update (3 files)
   - .claude/commands/work.md — new verification step
   - .claude/agents/verify-agent.md — updated check criteria
   - .claude/support/reference/workflow.md — updated process docs

   Impact: Adds scope validation to the verification process.
   Classification: 2 Template content not yet applied, 1 Modified upstream

2. New reference file
   - .claude/support/reference/new-feature.md

   Impact: Documentation only. No effect on existing workflow.

Apply all / Select individually / Skip?
```

**Grouping heuristic:** Changes are "related" when they touch the same workflow area (e.g., a command and the reference docs it depends on, or multiple files in the verification pipeline).

**Per-file actions (when selecting individually):**

For each file, the menu offers:

- **[A] Apply** — check out the template version (overwrites local).
- **[K] Keep current** — leave local as-is for this sync run. The sidecar entry is NOT updated, so the file resurfaces on the next sync.
- **[D] Show me the diff** — print `git diff template/{branch}:<path> <path>` (full output, truncate to ~100 lines if very long with a "...truncated" marker) and re-display the per-file menu.

Defaults differ by status:
- "Template content not yet applied" → default keystroke is `[A] Apply` (Enter applies).
- "Modified upstream" → no default; the user must explicitly pick to avoid accidental overwrites of genuine local additions.

The "Show me the diff" sub-action helps users adjudicate when classification is ambiguous — e.g., pre-3.15.0 projects without a sidecar (every diff falls into "Modified upstream"), or files genuinely modified locally where the user has forgotten what they changed.

#### 4. Apply Updates

Read the upstream `template_version` from `template/{default_branch}:.claude/version.json`.

For accepted changes:
- Check out the accepted files from `template/{default_branch}` into the working tree
- Update `template_version` in local `.claude/version.json` to match the upstream version
- **Update the sync-state sidecar** — for each file the user accepted, compute the new local SHA-256 (post-checkout) and write/update its entry in `.claude/.sync-state.json` under `files["<path>"].synced_hash`. Refresh top-level `last_full_sync_version` (to the upstream version just synced) and `last_full_sync_date` (current date, ISO 8601). If the sidecar doesn't exist yet, create it with `schema_version: "1.0"`. Files the user skipped retain their prior sidecar entries (or remain absent if never synced).
- Report what was changed

**Post-sync dashboard re-check:** After applying template updates, check if any dashboard-related files were updated (any file matching `dashboard-regeneration.md`, `rules/dashboard.md`, or `shared-definitions.md`). If so, the dashboard was generated with older format rules — offer to regenerate: `"Dashboard format rules updated — regenerate dashboard to apply new format? [Y/N]"`. This catches the ordering issue where Part 1 ran dashboard checks before Part 5 synced the new rules. Regeneration follows `.claude/support/reference/dashboard-regeneration.md` (which is now the updated version).

### Key Rules

- **Actual file diffs required** — you MUST `git fetch template` and diff each sync file against the remote. Comparing `template_version` strings is NOT a substitute for file-level comparison. Version numbers can match while files diverge (e.g., local edits, partial syncs, template patches). The version number is only used for display and for updating `version.json` after applying changes.
- **Sync category only** — never touch `customize` or `ignore` category files
- **Local-only files are kept** — never suggest removing files that aren't in the template
- **No silent changes** — always present changes and get confirmation before applying
- **Fetch only** — never merge, pull, or rebase from the template remote
- **Sidecar populates silently on first sync** — `.claude/.sync-state.json` appears the first time Step 4 applies updates after 3.15.0. No user-facing announcement; the file is gitignored.
- **Sidecar absence is fine** — pre-3.15.0 projects (no sidecar) fall through to "Modified upstream" classification for every diff. Behavior matches pre-3.15.0; sidecar populates on the first successful sync.

### Report Format

**Up to date (no diffs in sync files):**
```
### Template Sync

✓ Template up to date (v1.5.0)
```

**Offline / fetch failed:**
```
### Template Sync

⚠️ Cannot reach template repository — skipping template sync
```

**Missing config:**
```

ℹ️ Template sync not configured (missing version.json or sync-manifest.json)
```

**Remote not configured (first run):**
```
### Template Sync

ℹ️ Adding template remote: {template_repo}
```

## Part 5b: Command Collision Detection

Detects when custom commands in `.claude/commands/` overlap with template commands.

### Process

1. **Identify template commands** — known set: `work.md`, `iterate.md`, `breakdown.md`, `health-check.md`, `status.md`, `research.md`, `feedback.md`, `review.md`, `audit-coherence.md`, `audit-ui.md`, `diagnose.md`, `grill.md`, `zoom-out.md`
2. **Scan `.claude/commands/`** for all `.md` files not in the template set
3. **Detect collisions:**
   - **Name collision:** custom file has same name as template command
   - **Functional overlap:** filename or content suggests overlap (e.g., `plan.md` → `/iterate`, `complete.md` → `/work complete`)
4. **Report** — list custom commands with any overlap warnings

Never delete or rename custom commands without user consent.

---

## Part 5c: Settings Boundary Validation

Validates the layered-settings contract: `.claude/settings.json` is template-owned (base `permissions.allow` + base `permissions.ask` per DEC-016); `.claude/settings.local.json` is user-owned (all user additions, hooks, env vars, theme). Enforcing the boundary prevents template sync from silently clobbering user edits.

### Process

1. **Check for presence:**
   - If `.claude/settings.json` is missing: informational only (will be created by next template sync).
   - If `.claude/settings.local.json` is missing: informational only (user has no overrides yet — fine).

2. **Validate template-owned `settings.json` scope:**
   - Parse `.claude/settings.json` as JSON.
   - If parse fails: ❌ error — "`.claude/settings.json` is not valid JSON. Sync may have been interrupted; re-run `/health-check` to re-sync."
   - Check that the file contains **only** `permissions.allow` and/or `permissions.ask`:
     - ✅ Pass: the top-level object has exactly one key (`permissions`) whose value has only the keys `allow` and/or `ask`.
     - ⚠️ Warn if any of the following are present: `permissions.deny`, `hooks`, `env`, `theme`, or any other top-level key.
     - Warning message:
       ```
       ⚠️ Found non-base entries in `.claude/settings.json` (template-owned file).
          Unexpected keys: {list}
          These will be overwritten on next template sync.
          Move them to `.claude/settings.local.json` to preserve them.
          [M] Move automatically  [S] Skip (accept overwrite on next sync)
       ```
     - On `[M]`: merge the unexpected entries into `.claude/settings.local.json` (create if missing, concatenate+dedupe for array fields like `permissions.allow`, preserve existing keys for object fields like `hooks`), then strip them from `.claude/settings.json`. On `[S]`: leave files as-is; next sync will overwrite.

3. **Validate base-set drift (template vs. local):**
   - Read the template's `.claude/settings.json` from the template remote (if configured and reachable — same fetch as Part 5). Skip this check if offline.
   - Compare the local `permissions.allow` AND `permissions.ask` arrays against the template's.
   - If entries differ: this is normal (user has not yet synced, or template has been updated). Part 5's sync flow will offer the update — no Part 5c action needed.
   - This check exists purely to reassure users that additions/removals from the template base will propagate through normal sync.

4. **Report:**
   - Pass: `✓ Settings layer valid (template-owned base + user-owned local)`
   - Warnings: emit the warning block from step 2 above.

### Rationale

Claude Code's runtime concatenates `permissions.allow[]` and `permissions.ask[]` across all settings layers, so the user's additions in `settings.local.json` combine automatically with the template's base in `settings.json`. The template-owned file exists for two jobs: shipping a conservative base allow-set (read-only git/filesystem commands) AND a base ask-set (template-wide guardrails for spec/decision/vision file edits per DEC-016). Everything else (project-specific permissions, hooks, env vars, theme) belongs in the user-owned file.

---

## Part 5d: Cross-Project Bridge Configuration (downstream projects only)

Validates the `template_inbox_path` configuration that powers the cross-project feedback bridge. Skipped in the template repo (mirror of Part 7's detection: `system-overview.md` at project root indicates the template repo, where bridging to itself is not meaningful).

### Process

1. **Repo-type detection:** If `system-overview.md` exists at project root, skip Part 5d entirely.

2. **Read configuration:** Read `.claude/version.json` → `template_inbox_path`.

3. **If `template_inbox_path` is empty string (unconfigured):**

   This is not an error — the bridge is optional. Inform the user once per `/health-check` run:
   ```
   Cross-project feedback bridge: not configured.

   The bridge lets `/feedback template: <text>` carry template-relevant feedback
   back to the template repo's inbox automatically. `/health-check` in the template
   repo then routes those entries into `template-maintenance/feedback.md`.

   Configure now? (You can do this any time later.)
     [Y] Yes — enter the absolute path to the template repo's interaction-logs/inbox/
     [N] No — keep the bridge disabled
   ```

   - On `[Y]`:
     - Prompt: `Path to template inbox (absolute path, e.g. /Users/you/Developer/claude_code_environment/interaction-logs/inbox):`
     - Expand `~` and `$HOME` if present in the user's input
     - Validate that the path exists and is a directory
     - If valid: update `.claude/version.json` `template_inbox_path` field with the absolute path. Report: `✓ template_inbox_path configured: {path}`
     - If invalid: report the specific issue (not a directory / doesn't exist) and offer `[R] Retry | [S] Skip`
   - On `[N]`: silent pass — proceed to next Part

4. **If `template_inbox_path` is set and the path exists as a directory:**

   Silent pass. In the final `/health-check` report, include: `✓ Cross-project bridge: enabled ({path})`

5. **If `template_inbox_path` is set but the path doesn't exist or isn't a directory:**

   Surface as a fixable issue:
   ```
   ⚠️  template_inbox_path is set to '{path}' but that path doesn't exist (or is not a directory).

   Options:
     [F] Fix — enter a corrected path (validated against filesystem)
     [C] Clear — set to empty string (disables the bridge)
     [S] Skip — leave as-is, surface again on next /health-check
   ```

   Apply the chosen action. On `[F]`, follow the same validation flow as step 3 `[Y]`.

### When to Run

Runs on every `/health-check` in downstream projects. Cost is one JSON read + one directory stat — negligible compared to other parts. Surfacing the unset state once per run keeps the bridge discoverable without being noisy (Quick capture and `/work` paths are unaffected).

### Rationale

The bridge is purely opt-in (per `/feedback template:` semantics — silently no-ops when unset). Without surface area in `/health-check`, the configuration is invisible to most users — the `template_inbox_path` slot ships empty, and nothing else prompts the user to set it. Part 5d closes that discoverability gap without imposing the bridge on users who don't want it.

---

## Part 6: UX Evaluation

Assesses dashboard readability, project structure clarity, and interaction quality. Findings contribute to the overall health-check status (HEALTHY / NEEDS ATTENTION / CRITICAL ISSUES).

**Severity framework:** Nielsen's 0-4 scale mapped to health-check indicators:
- Severity 0-1 (cosmetic): `ℹ️` info — noted but doesn't affect status
- Severity 2 (minor): `⚠️` warning — contributes to NEEDS ATTENTION
- Severity 3-4 (major/catastrophic): `❌` error — contributes to CRITICAL ISSUES

### Initial Checks (targeting known issues)

The check catalog starts minimal and grows based on real usage feedback. Initial checks target three observed problems:

#### 1. Mermaid Diagram Readability (H3 — Visualization Integrity)

Parse Mermaid code blocks in `dashboard.md`. Count nodes in each diagram.

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| ≤15 nodes | Pass | — |
| 16-50 nodes without `%%critical-path-only` comment | Warn: "Mermaid diagram has {N} nodes — may be unreadable. Consider critical-path-only mode." | 2 |
| >50 nodes | Error: "Mermaid diagram has {N} nodes — will render unreadably small." | 3 |

#### 2. Workspace Document Graduation (H6 — Project Structure Clarity)

Count files in `.claude/support/workspace/` that are either: (a) linked from dashboard content, or (b) listed in `files_affected` of tasks with `owner: human` or `owner: both`.

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 0-2 workspace files referenced | Pass | — |
| 3+ workspace files referenced by human/both tasks | Warn per file: "'{filename}' is in workspace but referenced by human task {id}. Consider moving to project root (e.g., `docs/`)." | 2 |

#### 3. User Notes Section Utilization (H5 — User-Input Effectiveness)

Check if the Notes section in `dashboard.md` contains only the default placeholder text after the project has 5+ completed tasks.

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Notes has user content, or <5 tasks completed | Pass | — |
| Notes is default placeholder, 5+ tasks completed | Info: "Notes section is still the default placeholder. Add Quick Links or project-specific notes." | 1 |

#### 4. Action Required Actionability (H4 — Navigation)

**4a. Actionability.** Every item in the Action Required section should have a file link and a completion command or checkbox.

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All items have links | Pass | — |
| Item missing link or action | Error per item: "Action Required item '{title}' has no link or completion command." | 3 |

**4b. Summary-shape content (FB-015 / FB-038).** Scan the Action Required section for retrospective content that violates the rule in `support/reference/dashboard-regeneration.md` § Action Item Contract ("must NOT include work summaries, completion reports, or recent-activity recaps").

Detection heuristics — flag if ANY match within the Action Required section:

- **Past-tense completion verbs** in item title or body (not in the imperative form): `finished`, `completed`, `shipped`, `fixed`, `Task {N} finished/completed`, `successfully added/removed`. Watch for false positives — "Complete the form" is imperative (OK); "Form completed" is retrospective (flag).
- **Forbidden sub-section headings:** `Recent Activity`, `Work Summary`, `Completed This Session`, `Recently Completed`, `Done` (as a section name, not a checkbox label).
- **Long prose items:** any single item with more than 2 paragraphs of prose. Legitimate actionable items rarely need that much explanation — the contract requires "just enough context to act."
- **Bulleted lists of finished work:** any bulleted list inside Action Required where >2 consecutive items start with past-tense verbs (e.g., "✅ Task 5 added X", "✅ Task 6 fixed Y").

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| No summary-shape content | Pass | — |
| Summary-shape match found | Error per match: "Action Required contains retrospective content: '{excerpt}'. Belongs in git log / task notes / nowhere — not the dashboard." | 3 |

When `4b` fires repeatedly across `/health-check` runs on the same project, the root cause is likely LLM emitter compliance rather than a documentation gap — escalate to FB-011 Family C (extract dashboard regeneration into a deterministic script, tracked in `template-maintenance/scripts-candidates.md`).

#### 5. Dashboard Length (H1 — Readability)

Count total lines in `dashboard.md`.

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| ≤300 lines | Pass | — |
| 301-500 lines | Warn: "Dashboard is {N} lines. Check that completed phases are collapsed." | 2 |
| >500 lines | Warn: "Dashboard is {N} lines — may be hard to scan. Review section toggles and phase collapsing." | 2 |

#### 6. Phase Collapsing Compliance (H2 — Information Density)

Check completed phases (all tasks Finished with passing verification) — they should be collapsed to a single summary line, not list individual tasks.

| Condition | Result | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All completed phases collapsed | Pass | — |
| Completed phase lists >3 individual tasks | Warn per phase: "Phase {N} is complete but lists {X} individual tasks. Should be collapsed to summary line." | 2 |

### Extending the Check Catalog

New checks should be added when:
- A UX problem is observed in a real project (not hypothetical)
- The check has a clear structural signal (can be verified from file content, not rendering)
- The threshold has low false-positive risk

Add new checks to the appropriate heuristic category (H1-H6) with a severity rating. DEC-001 interaction logs will be a source of new check candidates once implemented.

---

## Part 7: Interaction Log Processing (template repo only)

Processes cross-project session exports when `/health-check` runs in the template repo. Skipped in downstream projects.

**Detection:** Check if `system-overview.md` exists at the project root (template repo indicator). If not, skip this part entirely.

### Process

1. **Check inbox:** Read `interaction-logs/inbox/` for `.json` files
2. **If empty:** Report "No pending interaction logs" and continue
3. **For each export file:**
   a. Validate format (`export_version` required)
   b. **Dispatch by `kind` field:**
      - `kind: "user_feedback"` → go to step 3c (user-tagged feedback bridge from `/feedback template:`)
      - Otherwise (no `kind`, or other value) → go to step 3d (session export with markers + optional assessment)
   c. **User-feedback routing:**
      - Read `template-maintenance/feedback.md` AND `template-maintenance/feedback-archive.md`
      - Parse all `## FB-NNN:` headings to find the highest `FB-NNN`; next ID is `FB-{N+1}` (zero-padded to 3 digits)
      - Construct the proposed entry:
        ```markdown
        ## FB-NNN: [feedback.title]

        **Status:** new
        **Captured:** [captured_date]
        **Source:** Bridged from {source_project} {feedback.source_fb_id} (template_version {template_version}) via /feedback template:

        [feedback.body]
        ```
      - Present the proposed entry to the user and ask for confirmation before appending — never append silently (preserves the "Claude does not make decisions for the user" rule).
      - On confirmation: append to `template-maintenance/feedback.md`; move processed file to `interaction-logs/processed/`.
      - On decline: leave the file in `inbox/` so the user can re-run `/health-check` later.
   d. **Session-export marker parsing:**
      - Parse friction markers by template area:
        - `verify-agent` — verification failures, false positives, verification gaps
        - `implement-agent` — workflow deviations, scope creep, template gaps
        - `/work` — routing issues, session recovery problems
        - `/iterate` — spec change friction, drift issues
        - `design-guidance` — pushback opportunities, scope pivot detection
        - `user-experience` — dashboard issues, interaction mode mismatches
      - If Claude assessment is present (`export_quality: "full"`), extract design pushback opportunities and workflow friction notes
      - Move processed file to `interaction-logs/processed/`

4. **Aggregate across processed exports:**
   - Count recurring friction types (same `template_area` + similar `type` across multiple sessions/projects)
   - Flag patterns with 3+ occurrences as high-confidence insights

5. **Generate insights** for high-confidence patterns:
   - Write insight documents to `interaction-logs/insights/`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_{template-area}_{slug}.md`

6. **Route to `template-maintenance/feedback.md`:** For high-confidence patterns from step 5, construct proposed feedback items as new `FB-NNN` entries in `template-maintenance/feedback.md` (status: `new`, body references the insight document). Present each proposed entry to the user for confirmation before appending.

   When `/health-check` runs in the template repo, `template-maintenance/feedback.md` is the destination per root `CLAUDE.md` — `.claude/support/feedback/feedback.md` is the *shipped* path reserved for downstream projects only. (User-feedback bridges from step 3c also land here.)

7. **Report:**
   ```
   Interaction Logs:
     Processed: {N} new exports ({M} full, {P} markers-only)
     Patterns detected: {X} ({Y} high-confidence)
     Feedback items created: {Z}
     Inbox: {remaining} pending
   ```

## Part 8: Audit Dispatch

Discovers and dispatches project-applicable audit commands. Audits live in `.claude/commands/audit-*.md` (template-shipped or project-local) and self-declare their applicability via `applies_when` frontmatter. This Part is the user-facing entry point for running audits — it surveys what's applicable, presents a menu, and dispatches the user's selection.

Audits complement Parts 1-7: where Parts 1-7 are automated validation/processing that runs unconditionally, Part 8 is interactive — the user picks which audits to run based on what they want to investigate. See `template-maintenance/audit-command-family-proposal.md` for the full audit family design (commands, friction register, dashboard digest, [Fix it] mechanism, bundled apply).

### Discovery

1. Glob `.claude/commands/audit-*.md`. For each, parse YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   applies_when:
     any_file_exists: ["..."]               # at least one glob pattern must match a real file
     # OR
     package_json_has_dep: ["..."]          # at least one listed dep must appear in package.json
   estimated_runtime: "..."                  # informational, e.g., "2-3 min"
   prerequisites: ["..."]                    # informational, e.g., ["dev server reachable at {url}"]
   ---
   ```
2. Evaluate each `applies_when` against project state:
   - `any_file_exists`: true if at least one glob pattern matches a real file
   - `package_json_has_dep`: true if at least one listed dep appears in `dependencies` or `devDependencies` of any `package.json` in the project tree
3. Build the applicable-audits list. Audits whose `applies_when` evaluates false are silently skipped (not shown in menu).

### Menu Presentation

If 0 applicable audits: print `No audits applicable for this project shape.` and skip Part 8.

If 1+ applicable audits: present the menu inline:

```
Audits available for this project:

  [1] coherence  — spec/decision/path drift detection (~2-3 min)
  [2] ui         — web app surface walk + 7 quality lenses (~5-7 min, requires dev server)
  [A] all applicable
  [S] skip

Pick one or more (e.g., "1,2"), or skip:
```

Prompt the user. Accept comma-separated numbers, "A" / "all", or "S" / "skip" (default).

### Dispatch

For each selected audit:

1. **Pre-flight prerequisites.** If the audit's `prerequisites` list mentions "dev server reachable at {url}" or similar, attempt verification (curl the URL). If unreachable, print the audit's pre-flight error and SKIP this audit (continue with others, don't fail Part 8).
2. **Invoke the audit command.** The audit runs in the same conversation context (commands are loaded as instructions). Sequence: dispatch one at a time — audits are internally parallel via lens sub-agents; sequencing across audits keeps output legible and avoids MCP collisions (per `.claude/rules/agents.md` § "MCP and Parallel Execution" — `/audit-ui` uses Playwright MCP which can't be safely fanned out across parallel command invocations either).
3. **Capture digest.** Each audit writes `findings.md` and `digest.json` to `.claude/support/audits/{audit}-{ts}/`. Record the digest path for the aggregate summary.

### Aggregate Output

After all selected audits complete, print a combined summary:

```
Audit results:

  /audit-coherence (2026-05-15 14:30Z):
    23 raw findings → 8 clustered (3 bundle-eligible, 5 promote-eligible, 2 deduped to pending tasks)
    Report: .claude/support/audits/coherence-2026-05-15-1430/findings.md

  /audit-ui (2026-05-15 14:35Z):
    47 raw findings → 18 clustered (1 bundle-eligible, 17 promote-eligible, 4 deduped to pending tasks)
    Report: .claude/support/audits/ui-2026-05-15-1435/findings.md

To act on findings:
  Promote to feedback: /audit-{name} promote {audit-ts}
  (Stages 6-7 will add [Fix it] inline + bundled-apply batch UX — see audit family proposal)
```

Stage 6 has shipped — `bundle-eligible` digest items surface automatically on the dashboard's `🔍 Audit Findings` section with the inline `[Fix it]` token; other kinds render with an italicized kind annotation. Promote/Dismiss invocation patterns are documented in `dashboard-regeneration.md` § "Audit Findings sub-section" (tick + bulk CLI for promote; natural-language for dismiss). The inline summary + manual review of `findings.md` + `/audit-{name} promote {ts}` remains a complementary surface for context beyond what the dashboard digest shows.

### Skip Conditions

Part 8 is skipped entirely if:
- 0 applicable audits exist (silent — print one line, no menu)
- The user selects `[S]` from the menu
- (Future) Running with a `--no-audits` flag — not implemented yet; defer until pattern observed

### Edge Cases

- **Audit command malformed.** If `applies_when` parsing fails for a specific audit file, log a warning to chat (`Audit command audit-{name}.md has malformed applies_when — skipping.`) and continue. Don't fail the entire health-check.
- **Audit invocation fails mid-run.** If an audit errors out (capture phase fails, lens agent fails, etc.), the audit's own error handling kicks in. Part 8 captures the failure (which audits succeeded vs failed) and continues to the next selected audit.
- **Project-local audits.** A project may have its own `.claude/commands/audit-{custom}.md`. Part 8 discovers and surfaces these alongside template-shipped audits — no special treatment in the menu (just labeled by the audit name from the file). See Component 9 of the audit family proposal for the project→template graduation pattern.
- **Sub-mode invocations like `/audit-coherence promote {ts}`.** Part 8 only dispatches the audit-run mode (no positional args); it does NOT dispatch promote / fix-it / etc. Those are direct user invocations of the audit command, outside Part 8's scope.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Scan

```
READ all .claude/tasks/task-*.json files
READ .claude/dashboard.md
READ .claude/spec_v{N}.md (current spec — for completion gate checks)
READ .claude/CLAUDE.md
READ ./CLAUDE.md (root, if exists)
SCAN .claude/rules/ for rule files
READ all .claude/support/decisions/decision-*.md files
READ .claude/version.json (template version info)
READ .claude/sync-manifest.json (file categories)
SCAN .claude/support/previous_specifications/ for archived specs
SCAN .claude/support/workspace/ for stale files
SCAN for misplaced spec files in non-canonical locations
FETCH template remote and diff sync files (skip if offline)
```

### Step 2: Run Checks

- Part 1: Task system validation (checks 1-11)
- Part 2: Instruction files audit (2a: template alignment, 2b: root bloat, 2c: rules validation)
- Part 3: Decision system validation (checks 1-6)
- Part 4: Archive validation (checks 1-4)
- Part 5: Template sync + collision + settings checks
- Part 6: UX evaluation (checks 1-6)
- Part 7: Interaction log processing (template repo only)
- Part 8: Audit dispatch (interactive — present applicable audits, dispatch user selection)

### Step 3: Report

**Report sections:**

## Edge Cases

**Empty task list:** Reports "0 tasks — all checks pass" (healthy state for new projects)

**Large root `./CLAUDE.md` (>200 lines):** Flags as error, suggests extracting sections to `.claude/support/reference/project-*.md`

**`.claude/CLAUDE.md` deviations:** Presents diff and asks user to revert, keep, or merge

**Subtask ID collisions:** Detects `5_1` already exists before creating duplicate

**No decision records:** Reports "0 decisions — all checks pass" (healthy state for new projects)

**Malformed frontmatter:** Flags as error, requires manual YAML fix

**Missing version.json or sync-manifest.json:** Template sync skipped with informational note

**Template repo unreachable:** Template sync skipped gracefully, other checks still run

## When to Run

- Start of a work session
- After extensive task operations
- When something feels "off"
- Before major handoffs
- Periodically (weekly recommended for tasks and template sync, monthly for instruction files audit)
