# CLAUDE.md

Environment instructions for Claude Code. This file is template-owned — do not edit directly. Project-specific instructions belong in `./CLAUDE.md` (project root).

## Model Requirement

This environment is designed for **Claude Opus 4.7** (`claude-opus-4-7[1m]`). All agents (implement-agent, verify-agent, research-agent) must run on Opus 4.7.

**Output token constraint:** Claude Code caps output at 32K tokens per response (thinking + text + tool arguments share this budget). Agents should avoid writing large artifacts and reasoning deeply in the same response.

**Context budget:** 1M is headroom, not license. Keep agent context minimal — fewer, more accurate tokens produce higher-quality output. Prefer targeted reads, focused plans, and subagent delegation over broad context dumps.

## Navigation

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Project specification | `.claude/spec_v{N}.md` (source of truth) |
| Dashboard (navigation hub) | `.claude/dashboard.md` |
| Task data | `.claude/tasks/task-*.json` |
| Commands | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| Agent definitions | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| Decisions | `.claude/support/decisions/decision-*.md` |
| Reference docs | `.claude/support/reference/` |
| Vision documents | `.claude/vision/` |
| Workspace (scratch) | `.claude/support/workspace/` |
| Reference documents (inputs) | `.claude/support/documents/` |
| Feedback | `.claude/support/feedback/` |
| Project instructions | `./CLAUDE.md` (root) |

## Critical Invariants

- The spec is the source of truth. All work aligns with it, or the spec is updated intentionally.
- Verification is structurally enforced. A task cannot reach "Finished" without `task_verification.result == "pass"`.
- Use the project's task system (`.claude/tasks/task-*.json`). Never use built-in TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList tools.
- verify-agent always runs as a separate agent (fresh context, no implementation memory).
- Exactly one `spec_v{N}.md` exists in `.claude/` at any time.
- Never commit credentials to tracked files.
- Never create working documents in the project root — use `.claude/support/workspace/`.

## Environment Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/work` | Start or continue work (decompose, route to agents, complete tasks) |
| `/work pause` | Graceful wind-down (preserve context before compaction) |
| `/work complete` | Complete current in-progress task |
| `/iterate` | Spec review and refinement |
| `/review` | Implementation quality review (advisory, read-only) |
| `/status` | Quick view of project state |
| `/research` | Investigate options for decisions |
| `/feedback` | Capture and manage improvement ideas |
| `/breakdown {id}` | Split complex tasks into subtasks |
| `/health-check` | Validate system health and template sync |

## Session Management

**Ending a session:** Run `/work pause` before closing a long conversation. This writes a handoff file that the next `/work` picks up automatically. Without it, the next session re-derives state from task files alone and may miss context.

**Resuming:** Use `claude --continue` (last session) or `claude --resume` (pick from list) to resume with full conversation context. A fresh `/work` in a new conversation works but relies on handoff files and auto-memory — it won't have the reasoning from the previous session.

**Mid-session context pressure:** Use `/compact focus on [what matters]` to summarize while preserving specific context. CLAUDE.md and rules files survive compaction automatically.

**Plans:** Write plans to files (`.claude/support/workspace/`), not conversation context. To explore, plan, then execute with fresh context: discuss the plan, have Claude write it to a file, `/clear`, then tell Claude to read and execute the plan file. This replaces the old "compact with plan" workflow.

## Design Philosophy

This environment is domain-agnostic — it works for software, research, procurement, renovation, or any spec-driven project. Dashboard language, task tracking, and verification adapt to the project domain.

## Workflow Rules

Detailed workflow rules are in `.claude/rules/`:
- `task-management.md` — statuses, difficulty, ownership, parallel execution
- `spec-workflow.md` — spec lifecycle, propose-approve-apply, vision documents
- `decisions.md` — decision records, inflection points
- `dashboard.md` — navigation hub, interaction modes, regeneration strategy
- `agents.md` — agent separation, tool preferences, model requirement
- `archiving.md` — file placement, archive locations, credentials
- `session-management.md` — ending sessions, resuming, plans, context survival
