# Workspace

Claude's working area for temporary and in-progress documents.

## Directories

- **scratch/** - Throwaway notes, quick analysis, temporary thinking
- **research/** - Web search results, reference material, gathered context
- **drafts/** - Work-in-progress documents before they move to their final location

## Rules

1. **Use this location** - Never create working documents in the project root
2. **Simple names** - Use descriptive filenames (`api-comparison.md`, not `task-5-research.md`)
3. **Promotion is manual** - When a draft becomes permanent, discuss where it should go
4. **Clean up periodically** - Delete scratch files when no longer needed

## What goes where

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Quick notes while working | `scratch/` |
| Web search summaries | `research/` |
| API docs, reference material | `research/` |
| Design docs in progress | `drafts/` |
| Spec sections being drafted | `drafts/` |
