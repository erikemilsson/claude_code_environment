# Task Management

This repository now uses the formal task management system located in `.claude/tasks/`.

## Using Tasks

- **View all tasks**: See `.claude/tasks/task-overview.md`
- **Individual tasks**: `.claude/tasks/task-*.json` files
- **Manage tasks**: Use the commands in `.claude/commands/`
  - `/complete-task` - Start/finish tasks
  - `/breakdown` - Break down complex tasks
  - `/sync-tasks` - Update task-overview.md

## Legacy

This file previously tracked ad-hoc todos but has been replaced by the structured task management system for better tracking, breakdown, and status management.
