Analysis directory contains meta-analytical reports and audits of the repository itself (instruction audits, performance reports) - answers 'how well is the system working?'. Insights directory contains learned patterns and actionable intelligence extracted from analysis data (pattern catalogs, success recipes) - answers 'what should we do?'. Key distinction: Analysis = data collection/reports, Insights = pattern recognition/actionable learnings, Reference = how-to guides, Context = project understanding. Both serve template developers for continuous improvement cycle.",
