Ensure consistency in workflow, JSON schema, status values, and difficulty scoring approach while preserving PQ-specific 5-dimension scoring.",

  "notes": "Successfully aligned all 4 Power Query task management command files with base component:\n\n1. breakdown.md:\n   - Restructured to match base format (5 steps)\n   - Standardized JSON field names (breakdown_history)\n   - Made auto-completion logic identical to base\n   - Preserved PQ-specific complexity dimensions and breakdown patterns\n   - Changed example to PQ-specific Gold_Calculate_CFF query\n\n2. complete-task.md:\n   - Reorganized from 10 to 8 steps matching base structure\n   - Standardized parent auto-completion logic (exact match to base)\n   - Standardized JSON field names (actual_hours, updated_date)\n   - Added transparency requirements for documenting deviations/fixes\n   - Preserved all PQ workflow steps (context loading, LLM pitfalls checklist, schema validation, M code guidance)\n\n3. sync-tasks.md:\n   - Simplified from 250 to 85 lines (66% reduction)\n   - Matched base structure exactly (7 steps)\n   - Standardized emoji indicators and formatting\n   - Removed complex validation logic (belongs in update-tasks.md)\n   - Kept Phase 1 designation for PQ context\n\n4. update-tasks.md:\n   - Restructured to match base (7 steps)\n   - Standardized status values and field names\n   - Preserved superior PQ features: auto-fix logic, optimization suggestions, stale task detection, validation reporting\n   - Added Context Required section\n   - Could backport PQ enhancements to base in future\n\nAll files now have:\n- Consistent structure with base component\n- Standardized JSON schema\n- Identical auto-completion logic\n- Preserved PQ-specific valuable content (5-dimension scoring, Phase 0 context, schema validation)\n- Better alignment for future maintenance",
