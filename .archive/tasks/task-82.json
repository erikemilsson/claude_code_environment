  "completion_notes": "Moved 4 project-specific command files (setup_database.md, create_forms.md, run_analysis.md, generate_reports.md) from .claude/commands/ to examples/project-specific-commands/. These files were from the SIREN project and not applicable to the generic template. Created comprehensive README.md in examples directory explaining the purpose of each command, how to use them as examples, best practices demonstrated, and guidance for creating new project-specific commands. This cleanup reduces confusion about which commands are template-generic vs project-specific.",
