  "completion_notes": "Created comprehensive checkpoint-usage.md documenting the checkpoint system implemented in scripts/checkpoint-manager.py. Documentation covers: when to create checkpoints (auto triggers every 3 steps, before risky ops, manual triggers), complete usage guide (create/list/diff/restore/delete), storage structure, metadata format, integration with commands (complete-task, breakdown, validation gates), best practices, CLI reference, Python API, error handling, performance optimization, and troubleshooting. The checkpoint system provides fast state snapshots with SHA-256 verification and gzip compression for safe experimentation and recovery.",
