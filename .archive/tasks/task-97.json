  "completion_notes": "Created comprehensive undo-bootstrap.md command with: environment detection, user content preservation logic, three-category file classification (safe to delete/user content/ambiguous), detailed removal plan presentation, backup option, dry run mode, selective removal options, force removal with confirmation, safety checks (permission verification, git change detection), error handling, and recovery instructions. Command prevents accidental data loss while allowing clean environment reset."
