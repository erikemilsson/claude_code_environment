  "completion_notes": "Created comprehensive validation-gates-integration.md documenting how validation gates integrate with the task workflow. Documentation covers: 3 gate types (pre/mid/post execution), integration with complete-task workflow (starting/during/completing tasks), integration with breakdown and environment creation, gate configuration in agent-config.json, logging and monitoring, error handling, CLI interface, best practices (gates as hard stops), performance impact, and troubleshooting. Validation gates provide mandatory quality checkpoints that prevent errors through pre-validation of task readiness, progress verification during execution, and completion validation before marking tasks finished.",
