  "title": "Implement smart path detection in smart-bootstrap.md",
  "description": "Enhance smart-bootstrap.md to accept relative paths (~/Documents/spec.md, ./spec.md, spec.md) and search common macOS locations when files aren't found. Add a 'recent files' helper that searches ~/Documents/, ~/Downloads/, ~/Desktop/, and iCloud Drive for recent .md files. This reduces friction with complex macOS paths, especially iCloud Drive paths.",

Implemented comprehensive smart path detection in smart-bootstrap.md: (1) Task 105: Relative path expansion (~/,./,..), (2) Task 106: Fallback search in Documents/Downloads/Desktop, (3) Task 107: iCloud Drive recursive search with download status checks, (4) Task 108: Recent files helper with interactive selection, (5) Task 109: Complete documentation in mac-user-workflow-guide.md. Users can now provide paths in any format and system automatically finds specs across all locations including iCloud. Eliminates need to type complex 80+ character iCloud paths.",
