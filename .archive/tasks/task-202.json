  "notes": "Successfully implemented performance impact monitoring with:\n- Created performance_monitor.py module with real-time overhead tracking\n- Integrated self-monitoring into health_checker.py\n- Implemented auto-disable safety mechanism (triggers at 5% overhead after 3 consecutive breaches)\n- Updated thresholds.json with monitoring_overhead configuration\n- Enhanced dashboard with real-time monitoring performance metrics\n- All validation criteria met: measures overhead, tracks memory/CPU, monitors I/O, and auto-disables if needed"
