  "description": "Implement path expansion to handle relative paths: ~ (home directory), . (current directory), .. (parent directory), and simple filenames. Add logic to expand these to absolute paths before validation. This allows users to type '~/Documents/spec.md' instead of full absolute paths.",

Implements expansion logic for all path types: absolute, tilde (~), current (.), parent (..), and relative paths. Provides clear expansion process and examples. Documented that this is foundation for Tasks 106-108. Foundation for smart path detection now in place.",
