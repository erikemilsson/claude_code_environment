The command should analyze a spec file and provide feedback on template detection confidence, found signals, missing signals, and recommendations for improvement. This prevents users from running bootstrap with specs that will fail or produce ambiguous results.",

  "notes": "HIGH IMPACT - Phase 1 Quick Win. COMPLETED: Created comprehensive validate-spec.md command (.claude/commands/validate-spec.md) that implements full detection logic matching smart-bootstrap. Features: (1) Analyzes specs using template-selection-rules.md patterns, (2) Calculates confidence scores (0-100%) for all template types, (3) Identifies missing signals with specific suggestions, (4) Handles edge cases (empty, ambiguous, perfect specs), (5) Provides actionable improvement suggestions with examples, (6) Guarantees consistency with bootstrap (same detection logic), (7) Includes 3 detailed usage examples, (8) Error handling for file not found/invalid format. Command provides validation guarantee: if validate-spec shows ≥70% confidence, smart-bootstrap will auto-select same template. Addresses 'Specification Creation Friction' pain point by giving users early feedback before bootstrap.",
