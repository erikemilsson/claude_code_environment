Implements search across common macOS locations in priority order: current dir, Documents, Downloads, Desktop. Handles single match (auto-use), multiple matches (list with timestamps for user choice), and no matches (proceed to iCloud search in Task 107). Includes example interaction showing automatic detection. Builds on Task 105's path expansion.",
