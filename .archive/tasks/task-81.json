  "completion_notes": "Created task-schema-consolidated.md combining all three schema documents (task-schema.md, task-schema-v2.md, enhanced-task-schema.md). The consolidated schema uses flat belief tracking structure (currently used by all tasks) with optional progress tracking for complex tasks. Created SCHEMA-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md documenting the consolidation, migration path, and future schema evolution process. Added deprecation notices to all three old schema files. No migration needed for existing tasks as they already use the correct flat structure.",
