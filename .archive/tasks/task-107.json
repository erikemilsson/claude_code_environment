Implements recursive search in iCloud Drive path with 5-level depth limit for performance. Handles downloaded files vs placeholders (.icloud extension, zero bytes). Warns users when file is cloud-only and not downloaded. Includes two example interactions: successful find in iCloud, and pending download warning. Builds on Task 106's fallback search.",
