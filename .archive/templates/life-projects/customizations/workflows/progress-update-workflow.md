**When issues arise:**
- Document the problem
- Note impact on timeline/budget
- Record solution or mitigation
- Create new tasks if needed

**At milestones:**

## Photo Documentation

### What to Photograph

**Before starting:**
- Initial state from multiple angles
- Problem areas or concerns
- Measurements and dimensions
- Adjacent areas for reference

**During work:**
- Completed phases before covering up
- Behind-the-wall work (plumbing, electrical)
- Issues discovered
- Quality concerns
- Progress at regular intervals

**After completion:**
- Final results from same angles as "before"
- Detail shots of key features
- Any remaining punch list items

### Photo Organization
