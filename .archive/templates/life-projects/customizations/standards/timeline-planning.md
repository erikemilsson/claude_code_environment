# Timeline Planning Standards

Guidelines for creating realistic project schedules and managing timelines effectively.

## Timeline Fundamentals

### Key Principles

1. **Work backwards from deadline** - If you have a fixed end date
2. **Work forwards from dependencies** - If timeline is flexible
3. **Build in buffers** - Things always take longer than expected
4. **Account for dependencies** - Task order matters
5. **Consider external factors** - Vendor schedules, weather, availability

### Timeline Components

**Phases:**
- Discovery/Research
- Planning/Design
- Execution/Implementation
- Completion/Closeout

**Milestones:**
- Key decision points
- Phase transitions
- External dependencies (permits, deliveries)
- Inspection or approval gates

**Tasks:**
- Individual work items
- Should be completable in days, not months
- Clear start and end criteria

**Buffers:**
- Between dependent phases
- For vendor lead times
- For unexpected issues
- For decision-making time

## Creating a Timeline

### Step 1: List All Major Activities

Break project into phases and major activities:

**Example: Bathroom Renovation**
```
Research Phase:
- Research shower systems (3 days)
- Research tile options (2 days)
- Get contractor referrals (2 days)
- Research permit requirements (1 day)

Planning Phase:
- Get contractor quotes (2 weeks - waiting on them)
- Select materials (1 week)
- Finalize design (3 days)
- Apply for permit (1 week - waiting on approval)

Execution Phase:
- Demo old bathroom (2 days)
- Rough plumbing (3 days)
- Rough electrical (1 day)
- Inspection (1 day - waiting on inspector)
- Install shower pan and walls (3 days)
- Tile work (5 days)
- Paint (2 days)
- Install fixtures (2 days)
- Final touches (2 days)

Completion Phase:
- Final inspection (1 day - waiting on inspector)
- Punch list items (2 days)
- Cleanup (1 day)
```

### Step 2: Estimate Durations

**For Tasks You'll Do:**
- Estimate realistically based on your skill level
- Add learning curve time if new to you
- Include setup and cleanup time
- Double your initial estimate (seriously)

**For Professional Work:**
- Ask vendor for timeline
- Check their typical lead time
- Add buffer for scheduling
- Confirm their availability

**For Waiting/Approvals:**
- Research typical processing times
- Call to confirm current timelines
- Add buffer (permits often delayed)
- Plan around holidays

### Step 3: Map Dependencies

Identify what must happen in order:

**Sequential Dependencies:**
```
Demo → Plumbing → Inspection → Tile
```
Can't tile until plumbing is inspected and approved.

**Parallel Work:**
```
Research shower systems
     AND
Research tile options
     AND
Get contractor referrals
```
Can all happen at the same time.

**Soft Dependencies:**
```
Select materials ← Should happen before demo (preferred)
     BUT
Can still select materials during demo (not ideal)
```

### Step 4: Add Buffers

**Between phases:** 2-3 days
**For vendor work:** 1-2 weeks scheduling flexibility
**For permits/approvals:** 2x the stated processing time
**For delivery:** 1-2 weeks beyond quoted lead time
**Overall project:** 20-30% total timeline buffer

### Step 5: Create Schedule

**Use Critical Path:**
1. Identify longest path through dependencies
2. That's your minimum timeline
3. Add buffers to get realistic timeline
4. Check against any fixed deadlines

**Example Timeline:**
```
Week 1-2: Research and Planning
  Days 1-3: Research (shower, tile, contractors)
  Days 4-5: Refine options
  Days 6-10: Get quotes, select contractor
  Days 11-14: Select materials, finalize design

Week 3: Permitting and Ordering
  Days 15-17: Submit permit application
  Days 15-17: Order materials (parallel)
  Days 18-21: Wait for permit (buffer included)

Week 4-6: Execution
  Days 22-23: Demo
  Days 24-26: Rough plumbing
  Day 27: Rough electrical
  Day 28: Inspection
  Days 29-33: Shower installation
  Days 34-38: Tile work
  Days 39-40: Paint
  Days 41-42: Fixtures
  Days 43-44: Final touches

Week 7: Completion
  Day 45: Final inspection
  Days 46-47: Punch list
  Day 48: Cleanup and done!

Total: 7 weeks (includes buffers)
Without buffers: 5 weeks (not realistic)
```

## Managing the Timeline

### Tracking Progress

**Daily (During Active Work):**
- Mark completed tasks
- Note any delays or issues
- Update expected completion dates
- Communicate changes to vendors

**Weekly:**
- Review upcoming week's tasks
- Confirm vendor schedules
- Identify potential conflicts
- Adjust timeline if needed

**At Milestones:**
- Assess if timeline is realistic
- Calculate buffer used
- Forecast completion date
- Decide on any corrective actions

### Dealing with Delays

**When a task takes longer than expected:**

1. **Assess impact:**
   - How much longer will it take?
   - What tasks are now delayed?
   - Is the delay on critical path?

2. **Adjust timeline:**
   - Update task completion date
   - Shift dependent tasks
   - Recalculate overall completion
   - Use buffer if available

3. **Communicate:**
   - Inform affected vendors
   - Update stakeholders
   - Reschedule as needed

4. **Learn:**
   - Note why estimate was wrong
   - Adjust future estimates
   - Add to lessons learned

### Acceleration Strategies

**If you need to make up time:**

**Safe approaches:**
- Add more working hours (if doing yourself)
- Parallelize tasks that were sequential
- Reduce scope (cut nice-to-haves)
- Simplify (standard instead of custom)

**Risky approaches:**
- Rush work (quality suffers)
- Skip planning (mistakes happen)
- Pressure vendors (strained relationships)
- Cut corners (problems later)

**Don't:**
- Skip safety steps
- Ignore code requirements
- Skip necessary prep work
- Compromise structural integrity

## Common Timeline Issues

### Issue 1: Optimistic Estimates

**Problem:** "It should only take a weekend"
- Actually takes 3 weekends plus 2 weeknights
- Forgot about prep, cleanup, trips to store
- Didn't account for learning curve
- Weather delays outdoor work

**Solution:**
- Double your initial estimate
- Add explicit time for prep and cleanup
- Include learning and problem-solving time
- Check historical weather patterns

### Issue 2: Vendor Delays

**Problem:** Contractor scheduled for Monday, shows up Friday
- Other jobs run long
- Material deliveries delayed
- Crew availability issues
- Weather impacts

**Solution:**
- Build in 1-2 week buffer for vendor scheduling
- Get committed dates in writing
- Have backup tasks for your time
- Maintain good relationship (they'll prioritize you)

### Issue 3: Approval Delays

**Problem:** Permit said "2 weeks" but took 6 weeks
- Incomplete application (resubmit)
- Reviewer backlog
- Questions or changes required
- Holidays and vacations

**Solution:**
- Submit early
- Ensure application is complete
- Follow up regularly
- Plan for 2x stated timeline

### Issue 4: Material Delays

**Problem:** Tile on backorder, now 8 week lead time
- Supply chain issues
- Seasonal availability
- Discontinued items
- Shipping delays

**Solution:**
- Order materials early
- Check availability before committing to selection
- Have backup options identified
- Track orders proactively

### Issue 5: Scope Creep

**Problem:** "While we're at it" additions keep extending timeline
- New ideas during execution
- Related issues discovered
- Stakeholder requests

**Solution:**
- Document all changes before starting
- Assess timeline impact
- Decide if it's worth the delay
- Consider phasing (do later)

## Milestone Definitions

### What Makes a Good Milestone

**Criteria:**
- Represents significant progress
- Has clear completion criteria
- Marks transition or decision point
- Useful for communication
- Aligned with dependencies

**Examples of Good Milestones:**
- "Materials selected and ordered"
- "Permit approved"
- "Rough work complete and inspected"
- "Installation complete"
- "Final inspection passed"

**Examples of Poor Milestones:**
- "Making progress" (vague)
- "Almost done" (unclear)
- "Contractor came by" (not an achievement)

### Milestone Reviews

At each milestone:
1. **Confirm completion criteria met**
2. **Review timeline to date**
   - Were we on schedule?
   - What caused delays?
   - Did we use buffer time?
3. **Look ahead**
   - Is next phase ready to start?
   - Any new dependencies or blockers?
   - Update timeline if needed
4. **Document**
   - Photos at this stage
   - Lessons learned so far
   - Any decisions made

## Seasonal and External Factors

### Weather Considerations

**Outdoor work:**
- Check historical weather patterns
- Avoid rainy seasons if possible
- Have indoor backup tasks
- Plan for weather delays

**Temperature-sensitive:**
- Paint (temperature and humidity ranges)
- Concrete (frost and heat)
- Roofing (no rain, not too hot)

### Seasonal Availability

**Contractor availability:**
- Busy season (spring/summer for many trades)
- Slow season (winter for outdoor work)
- Holiday periods (reduced availability)

**Material availability:**
- Seasonal items (patio furniture, holiday decor)
- Supply chain patterns
- Sale seasons (can save money)

### Personal Availability

**Your schedule:**
- Work commitments
- Vacations and travel
