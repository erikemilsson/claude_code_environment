# Project Planning Standards

Guidelines for planning and scoping life projects effectively.

## Project Definition

### Essential Elements

Every project should clearly define:

1. **Goals and Objectives**
   - What success looks like
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Must-haves vs nice-to-haves
   - Quality expectations

2. **Constraints**
   - Budget (total and breakdown)
   - Timeline (start date, deadline, milestones)
   - Resources (DIY vs professional help)
   - Physical limitations (space, access, codes)

3. **Stakeholders**
   - Decision makers
   - Users/beneficiaries
   - Approvers (HOA, permits, family)
   - Helpers and support

4. **Scope Boundaries**
   - What's included
   - What's explicitly excluded
   - Adjacent work to consider
   - Future expansion possibilities

## Planning Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery (10-20% of timeline)

**Activities:**
- Research options and best practices
- Gather inspiration and examples
- Understand requirements and constraints
- Identify potential issues early
- Get rough cost estimates

**Deliverables:**
- Initial project brief
- Research notes
- Rough budget estimate
- Risk assessment

### Phase 2: Design (15-25% of timeline)

**Activities:**
- Make key decisions on approach
- Create detailed plans or specifications
- Select materials and vendors
- Refine budget with quotes
- Identify dependencies

**Deliverables:**
- Detailed project plan
- Material selections
- Vendor/contractor quotes
- Updated budget with line items
- Task breakdown with timeline

### Phase 3: Execution (50-65% of timeline)

**Activities:**
- Complete tasks in dependency order
- Track progress and document
- Handle issues and changes
- Coordinate vendors/helpers
- Monitor budget and timeline

**Deliverables:**
- Regular progress updates
- Photo documentation
- Issue resolution notes
- Updated budget tracking
- Completed work

### Phase 4: Completion (5-10% of timeline)

**Activities:**
- Final inspections and quality checks
- Address punch list items
- Organize documentation
- Capture lessons learned
- Celebrate completion

**Deliverables:**
- Final photos and documentation
- Warranty and receipt storage
- Vendor ratings and feedback
- Lessons learned summary
- Project archive

## Risk Management

### Identify Risks Early

Common risk categories:
- **Budget overruns** - Unexpected costs, scope creep
- **Timeline delays** - Vendor scheduling, material delays, weather
- **Quality issues** - Poor workmanship, defective materials
- **Scope problems** - Changing requirements, new discoveries
- **Coordination** - Multiple vendors, access conflicts

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Budget Contingency**
   - Add 15-20% for typical projects
   - Add 25-30% for older homes or uncertain scope
   - Track separately in budget

2. **Timeline Buffers**
   - Add buffer between dependent phases
   - Account for vendor lead times
   - Plan around holidays and weather

3. **Quality Controls**
   - Research vendor reviews thoroughly
   - Get detailed contracts and warranties
   - Inspect work at milestones
   - Document everything with photos

4. **Communication**
   - Set clear expectations upfront
   - Establish regular check-in schedule
   - Document all decisions and changes
   - Keep vendor contact info organized

## Task Breakdown Principles

### Granularity Guidelines

**Too Large (needs breakdown):**
- "Renovate bathroom" (Difficulty 9-10)
- "Plan wedding" (Difficulty 9-10)
- "Move to new city" (Difficulty 8-10)

**Right Size:**
- "Select shower tile" (Difficulty 4-5)
- "Get contractor quotes for plumbing" (Difficulty 3-4)
- "Research moving companies" (Difficulty 3)

**Too Small:**
- "Email contractor" (Difficulty 1)
- "Buy single item at hardware store" (Difficulty 1)

### Dependencies

Map dependencies clearly:
- **Sequential** - Must complete A before starting B
- **Soft dependencies** - Better to do A first, but not required
- **Parallel** - Can do simultaneously
- **External** - Waiting on vendor, permit, weather

Examples:
```
Demo old bathroom → Install new plumbing → Install tile
    ↓
  Get permits (can happen in parallel with demo)
    ↓
  Order materials (need to know what before demo)
```

## Decision-Making Framework

### For Major Decisions

1. **Define criteria** - Cost, quality, timeline, aesthetics, maintenance
2. **Research options** - At least 3 alternatives for significant choices
3. **Evaluate objectively** - Use comparison matrix
4. **Consider trade-offs** - No perfect option, understand compromises
5. **Document decision** - Record what you chose and why
6. **Review later** - Check if decision still makes sense

### When to Hire Professionals

Consider professional help when:
- Safety risk (electrical, structural, gas, heights)
- Code requirements (permits, inspections)
- Specialized tools or skills needed
- Time value exceeds learning curve
- Warranty or insurance requirements
- Mistakes would be costly to fix

DIY when:
- Low risk of mistakes
- Common tools and basic skills
- Learning has lasting value
- Time is available
- Tutorials are readily available
- Mistakes are easily correctable

## Documentation Standards

### What to Document

**Required:**
- All major decisions with rationale
- Budget estimates and actuals
- Vendor contact information
- Progress photos (before, during, after)
- Issues encountered and resolutions

**Recommended:**
- Material specifications and sources
- Measurements and dimensions
- Warranty and receipt storage
- Lessons learned
- Timeline with actual dates

## Communication Guidelines

### With Vendors/Contractors

**Before hiring:**
- Get at least 3 quotes for major work
- Check references and reviews
- Verify licenses and insurance
- Clarify scope and timeline
- Discuss payment schedule

**During work:**
- Establish preferred communication method
- Set regular check-in schedule
- Address issues promptly
- Document changes in writing
- Take progress photos

**After completion:**
- Do final walkthrough together
- Create punch list for any issues
- Make final payment when satisfied
- Get warranty information
- Provide feedback/review

### With Stakeholders

- Keep decision-makers informed at key milestones
- Set expectations on timeline and budget
- Communicate changes promptly
- Share progress photos
- Celebrate completions together

## Quality Assurance

### Inspection Points

Build in quality checks:
- After material delivery (check for damage)
- At completion of each phase
- Before covering up work (plumbing, electrical)
- Before final payment
- 30-day post-completion review

### Acceptance Criteria

Define what "done" means:
- Functional requirements met
- Quality standards achieved
- Code compliance verified
- No safety issues
- Cleanup completed
- Documentation provided
