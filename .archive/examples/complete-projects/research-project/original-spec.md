# Climate Change Impact on Coastal Ecosystems: Research Project

## Research Overview
Conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystem biodiversity, focusing on temperature rise, ocean acidification, and sea-level changes over the past 50 years.

## Research Questions

### Primary Question
How has climate change affected biodiversity in coastal ecosystems globally from 1970-2020?

### Secondary Questions
1. What is the correlation between temperature rise and species migration patterns?
2. How does ocean acidification impact coral reef biodiversity?
3. What are the tipping points for ecosystem collapse?
4. Which mitigation strategies show the most promise?

## Methodology

### Literature Review
- **Databases**: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar
- **Search Terms**: "climate change" AND "coastal ecosystem" AND ("biodiversity" OR "species richness")
- **Inclusion Criteria**:
  - Peer-reviewed articles
  - Published 1970-2024
  - Empirical data
  - English language
- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Opinion pieces
  - Studies without statistical analysis
  - Duplicate datasets

### Data Analysis
- **Statistical Methods**:
  - Meta-analysis using random effects model
  - Regression analysis for trend identification
  - Time-series analysis for temporal patterns
  - Spatial analysis using GIS
- **Software**: R (meta, metafor packages), Python (scipy, pandas), QGIS

### Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Temperature rise > 1.5°C correlates with >30% biodiversity loss
2. **H2**: Ocean pH decrease of 0.1 units reduces coral coverage by >20%
3. **H3**: Sea level rise > 30cm causes significant habitat fragmentation
4. **H0**: No significant relationship between climate variables and biodiversity

## Data Management
