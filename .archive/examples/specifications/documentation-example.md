# API Documentation Site for Payment Gateway

## Project Overview

Create comprehensive technical documentation for our payment gateway API, including developer guides, tutorials, API reference, and code examples.

## Goals

1. Reduce developer integration time from 2 weeks to 3-5 days
2. Decrease support tickets by 40% through better self-service documentation
3. Improve developer satisfaction scores
4. Attract more third-party integrations

## Content to Create

### API Reference
- Complete endpoint documentation (REST API)
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Error codes and troubleshooting
- Rate limiting and best practices
- Webhook documentation

### Developer Guides
- Getting started guide (quickstart in 10 minutes)
- Authentication setup guide
- Payment flow implementation guide
- Refunds and disputes handling
- Testing in sandbox environment
- Going live checklist

### Tutorials
- Accept your first payment (step-by-step)
- Implement recurring billing
- Handle payment failures gracefully
- Build a checkout page
- Integrate with popular frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)

### Code Examples
- SDKs: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Java
- Full example applications for each SDK
- Common use case examples
- Integration templates

## Documentation Site Features

- Search functionality
- Code playground (try API calls in-browser)
- Dark mode support
- Version switcher (API v1, v2)
- Interactive OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- Community contributions (GitHub-based)

## Technology Stack

- Documentation framework: Docusaurus or GitBook
- Hosting: Vercel or Netlify
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API spec
- Markdown for content
- GitHub for version control
- Algolia for search

## Style and Standards

- Use clear, concise language (8th-grade reading level)
- Show code examples in multiple languages
- Include practical use cases, not just theoretical docs
- Follow API documentation best practices (Stripe, Twilio as inspiration)
- Maintain consistent formatting and terminology

## Timeline

- Week 1-2: Content planning and information architecture
- Week 3-5: API reference documentation
- Week 6-8: Developer guides and tutorials
- Week 9-10: Code examples and SDKs
- Week 11-12: Site development, review, launch

## Success Metrics

- Time to first API call (developer activation)
- Documentation page views and engagement
- Support ticket reduction
- Developer satisfaction surveys
- Integration completion rates
