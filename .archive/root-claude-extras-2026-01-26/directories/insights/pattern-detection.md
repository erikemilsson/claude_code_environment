# Pattern Detection Insights

## Purpose
Track and analyze recurring patterns across project setups to improve template selection, task management, and project initialization workflows.

## Template Selection Patterns

### Most Frequently Used Templates
| Template | Usage Count | Confidence Avg | Common Use Cases | Success Rate |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Base | 0 | N/A | General purpose projects | N/A |
| Power Query | 0 | N/A | Excel data transformation, BI workflows | N/A |
| Research | 0 | N/A | Academic research, data analysis | N/A |
| Life Projects | 0 | N/A | Personal development, life management | N/A |
| Documentation | 0 | N/A | Technical writing, guides | N/A |

### Template Selection Indicators
- **Power Query Keywords**: "Excel", "Power BI", "DAX", "M language", "data transformation"
- **Research Keywords**: "analysis", "hypothesis", "data collection", "findings"
- **Life Projects Keywords**: "habits", "goals", "personal", "tracking", "wellness"
- **Documentation Keywords**: "guide", "manual", "reference", "tutorial", "how-to"

### Selection Confidence Patterns
- High confidence (90-100%): Clear keywords match, single domain focus
- Medium confidence (70-89%): Mixed indicators, multiple valid templates
- Low confidence (50-69%): Ambiguous requirements, needs clarification

## Task Difficulty Patterns

### Common High-Difficulty Tasks (7+)
| Pattern | Occurrence | Common Issues | Recommended Breakdown |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Architecture Setup | 0 | Scope creep, unclear requirements | Infrastructure → Components → Integration |
| Database Migration | 0 | Data integrity, rollback planning | Schema → Data → Validation |
| Authentication System | 0 | Security complexity, token management | Auth flow → Storage → Session handling |
| Distributed Systems | 0 | Coordination, fault tolerance | Service definition → Communication → Error handling |

### Difficulty Estimation Accuracy
- Overestimated tasks: 0 patterns identified
- Underestimated tasks: 0 patterns identified
- Accurate estimations: 0 patterns identified

## Assumption Failure Patterns

### Most Common Failed Assumptions
| Assumption Type | Failure Rate | Root Causes | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Technology Stack | 0% | Version conflicts, missing dependencies | Explicit version checking |
| User Expertise | 0% | Overestimation of technical skills | Graduated complexity |
| Data Availability | 0% | Missing sources, format issues | Early data validation |
| Time Estimates | 0% | Optimism bias, hidden complexity | Buffer addition, breakdown |

### Assumption Validation Timing
- Pre-project: Critical assumptions about environment, tools
- Early phase: Data sources, API availability
- Mid-project: Performance requirements, scaling needs
- Late phase: Deployment environment, user acceptance

## Emerging Project Types

### New Template Candidates
| Pattern | Frequency | Characteristics | Proposed Template |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| *None detected yet* | 0 | - | - |

### Hybrid Project Patterns
| Combination | Frequency | Use Cases | Complexity |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| *None detected yet* | 0 | - | - |

## Workflow Optimization Opportunities

### Bottleneck Patterns
| Stage | Average Delay | Common Causes | Optimization |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Template Selection | N/A | Ambiguous requirements | Two-step clarification |
| Task Breakdown | N/A | Difficulty underestimation | Automatic threshold triggers |
| Assumption Validation | N/A | Late discovery | Early validation checklist |

### Successful Workflow Patterns
| Pattern | Success Rate | Key Elements | Replication Guide |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Two-Step Bootstrap | N/A | Question → Confident selection | See two-step-processing.md |
| Hierarchical Breakdown | N/A | Parent → Children → Auto-complete | See breakdown-workflow.md |
| Confidence Tracking | N/A | Continuous assessment | See confidence-scoring.md |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Begin collecting pattern data from project executions
2. Implement automated pattern detection in smart-bootstrap
3. Create feedback loops for continuous improvement

### Future Improvements
1. Machine learning for template selection
2. Automated difficulty estimation refinement
3. Predictive assumption failure detection
4. Custom template generation based on patterns

## Data Collection Points

### What to Track
- Template selection: chosen template, confidence, alternatives considered
- Task breakdown: original difficulty, actual difficulty, breakdown decision
- Assumptions: stated vs actual, validation timing, failure impact
- Workflow: time per phase, bottlenecks, rework instances

### How to Track
- Automatic logging in commands
- Decision rationale capture
- Post-project reviews
- Pattern analyzer script execution

## Update Schedule
- Real-time: Pattern detection during project execution
- Daily: Aggregate pattern analysis
- Weekly: Trend identification and recommendation updates
- Monthly: Template and workflow optimization proposals
