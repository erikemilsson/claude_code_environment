# SIREN Project Context

## Project Definition
**Name**: SIREN - Systemic Investigation into REcycling of Neodymium
**Type**: Academic Research Project
**Duration**: February - June 2025
**Lead**: Environmental Research Institute

## Research Question
What are the root-cause barriers preventing effective collection and recycling of NdFeB permanent magnets from end-of-life products in the EU, and what interventions would most effectively address these constraints?

## Objectives
1. Map and prioritize barriers preventing NdFeB magnet recycling in EU-27
2. Identify root causes using Theory of Constraints analysis
3. Develop actionable interventions through stakeholder validation
4. Deliver scientific publication and technical report

## Scope
### In Scope
- EU-27 focus (priority: Sweden, Slovenia, Germany, Belgium)
- End-of-life NdFeB magnets from consumer products
- Full recycling value chain: Collection → Dismantling → Processing → Reintegration
- PESTLE analysis framework (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)

### Out of Scope
- Primary mining and virgin material production
- Product design phase (except as potential intervention)
- Detailed national policy analysis for all 27 member states
- Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) - explicitly excluded

## Methodology
### Three-Stage Theory of Constraints Process
1. **Stage 1: Evidence Collection & Factor Mapping** (Feb-Mar)
   - Literature review using PESTLE framework
   - Stakeholder data collection
   - Build factor database

2. **Stage 2: Constraint Identification Workshop** (May)
   - Present factor network
   - Identify causal relationships
   - Find core system constraint

3. **Stage 3: Solution Development Workshop** (May)
   - Design interventions
   - Build Future Reality Trees
   - Validate solutions

## Key Deliverables
1. Scientific publication (Resources, Conservation and Recycling or similar)
2. Technical report with full methodology
3. Open dataset for research community
4. GitHub repository with analysis code

## Team
- **Principal Investigator**: Project lead (1.0 FTE)
- **Research Assistant**: Data support (0.5 FTE)
- **Advisors**: LCA experts, mathematical modelers (as needed)
- **External**: Magnet manufacturer advisor (not full partner)

## Critical Success Factors
- Rigorous scientific analysis
- Stakeholder validation
- Clear constraint identification
- Actionable recommendations
- Value to both scientific and policy communities

## Key Constraints
- Limited budget (no payment for workshop participants)
- Voluntary stakeholder participation
- 5-month timeline
- Small core team

## Data Management
- Microsoft 365 ecosystem for collection
- PostgreSQL for storage
- Python for analysis
- Power BI for visualization
- All data on work computer/SharePoint
- IP owned by Environmental Research Institute
