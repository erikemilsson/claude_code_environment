# Advanced Extras

These extras are from the Universal Template and are useful for complex projects that need:
- Specification development before implementation
- Agent-based task routing
- Executive summary tracking

## When to Use These

- **Large projects** with multiple phases
- **Team projects** needing clear specifications
- **Complex features** needing architecture design before coding
- **Projects with stakeholders** who need executive summaries

## Contents

### Agents

Agent configurations for specialized tasks:

- **implementation-architect.md** - Design implementation approaches for complex tasks
- **specification-architect.md** - Validate specifications for completeness
- **test-generator.md** - Generate comprehensive test plans

### Planning Workflow

Commands for specification-driven development:

- **init-specification-command.md** - Set up planning phase with decision tracking

### Executive Summaries

Commands for maintaining high-level project views:

- **update-executive-summary-command.md** - Keep phases and decisions current

## How to Use

1. Copy the files you need to your project's `.claude/` folder
2. Follow the instructions in each file
3. Invoke agents via the Task tool when needed

## Simple Projects Don't Need This

If your project is straightforward:
- Just use the base/ template
- Add extras from development/ or project-management/ as needed
- These advanced extras add overhead that may not be worth it
