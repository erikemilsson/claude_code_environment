# Pension Calculation Implementation

## Project Overview

Implement pension calculation formulas based on the Swedish Pension Authority's regulatory document (PDF) using Power Query in Excel.

## Background

The Swedish Pension Authority has published a 45-page regulatory document describing pension calculation methodologies. The document contains multiple formulas with ambiguous variable definitions and some inconsistent terminology between sections.

## Technology

Power Query M language in Excel workbook

## Requirements

1. Parse the regulatory PDF document to extract calculation formulas
2. Interpret ambiguous variable definitions and document all interpretation decisions
3. Implement calculations in Power Query with proper error handling
4. Create data validation to ensure input data meets requirements
5. Generate audit trail for all calculations
6. Test against sample data provided by the authority

## Deliverables

1. Excel workbook with Power Query queries
2. Glossary of all variable definitions
3. Documentation of interpretation decisions for ambiguous requirements
4. Test cases and validation results
5. User guide for running calculations

## Timeline

Estimated 3-4 weeks for full implementation

## Compliance Requirements

- Zero-error tolerance (financial calculations)
- Full audit trail required
- All interpretation decisions must be documented for regulatory review
