# My 2024 Fitness and Health Journey

## Personal Goals

I want to get healthier in 2024 by tracking my fitness activities, planning better nutrition, and staying accountable to my goals.

## What I Want to Track

### Workouts
- Log each workout session (type, duration, exercises)
- Track progress on key lifts (bench press, squat, deadlift)
- Record cardio activities (running, cycling, swimming)
- Monitor rest days and recovery

### Nutrition
- Plan weekly meal prep
- Track macros (protein, carbs, fats)
- Log daily water intake
- Note energy levels and how food affects performance

### Body Measurements
- Weekly weigh-ins
- Monthly body measurements (waist, chest, arms, legs)
- Progress photos (monthly)
- Body fat percentage estimates

### Goals and Milestones
- Run a 5K by March (current: can't run 1K)
- Bench press bodyweight by June
- Lose 15 pounds by July
- Complete a half marathon by December

## How I Want to Organize This

- Simple workout log (date, exercises, sets, reps, weight)
- Meal planning template for weekly prep
- Progress tracking dashboard (charts showing trends)
- Goal checklist with target dates

## Timeline

This is an ongoing personal project throughout 2024. I'll review progress monthly and adjust goals as needed.

## Tools I'm Considering

- Spreadsheet or simple app for logging
- Maybe a fitness tracker (Fitbit/Apple Watch) integration later
- Photo storage for progress pics
- Notes for how I'm feeling each week

## Success Criteria

- Consistency: Log workouts at least 4x per week
- Progress: See measurable improvement in strength and endurance
- Health: Feel more energetic and healthy
- Habit formation: Make fitness a sustainable part of my routine
