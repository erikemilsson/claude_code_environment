# Scenario 43 — Acceptance-criteria reconciliation lens (DEC-022)

Conceptual trace test for DEC-022 Option D (A + C): the authority doctrine (`verification-result.json` `criteria[]` is the acceptance-*status* surface; inline spec `- [ ]` boxes are authored input) and the new advisory `acceptance-reconciliation` lens in `/audit-coherence`. Verifies the lens flags the flirty-gym symptom, stays silent for the common (box-less) case, never mutates the spec, and that the authority split is applied consistently.

## Setup / State

- A project with `.claude/spec_v2.md` that renders per-phase acceptance criteria as inline `- [ ]` checkboxes (an *optional* project convention — the template does not mandate it). flirty-gym shape: Phase 1 boxes all `[x]`, **Phase 2 boxes all `[ ]`**.
- `.claude/verification-result.json` exists with `result: "pass"` and `criteria[]` 7/7 `pass` (the latest phase-level result — Phase 2).
- The dashboard renders its Acceptance criteria section as `Acceptance criteria · 7/7 passed` (from that file).

## Trace A — lens flags the box-vs-`criteria[]` divergence (the flirty-gym symptom)

Command path: `commands/audit-coherence.md` Phase 1 capture step 9 → Lens prompts → "Lens 7 — `acceptance-reconciliation`" → Synthesizer.

1. Capture copies `.claude/verification-result.json` → `inputs/verification-result.json`.
2. The lens scans the active spec for inline `- [ ]` / `- [x]` boxes grouped by phase, then reads the verification result.
3. Phase 2's boxes are all `- [ ]` while `verification-result.json` records `result: "pass"` (7/7) → divergence.
4. The lens matches box labels to `criteria[].name` **advisorily** (fuzzy text similarity; free-text names, no ID link), labelling the correspondence as *suspected* for human review.

**Expected:** ONE finding clustered at Phase 2 — *"Phase 2: 0/N inline acceptance boxes ticked, but verification-result.json records result=pass (7/7 criteria)."* Source anchor = spec § Phase 2; `files_to_touch` = `spec_v*.md` → the synthesizer's HARD RULE classifies it `kind: decision`; suggested fix routes via `/iterate`.

**Pass criteria:** clustered per phase (not one finding per box); `kind: decision` (never `bundle-eligible` — spec path); the box↔criterion match is presented as suspected, not asserted; the lens emits text only and never edits the spec.

## Trace B — no inline boxes → `Findings: 0` (the common case, Q3)

Command path: "Lens 7 — `acceptance-reconciliation`" prompt § "This lens only applies when…".

State: the spec has an "Acceptance Criteria" section but renders **no** inline `- [ ]` boxes (the majority case — boxes are optional; the template never mandated them).

1. The lens scans for inline checkboxes → none found.

**Expected:** `Findings: 0` ("nothing to reconcile — inline boxes are an optional project convention"). The lens also returns `Findings: 0` when `inputs/verification-result.json` is `{}` / absent (no verified phase yet).

**Pass criteria:** the lens is silent for box-less specs and for unverified projects — no false positives on the common case; the optional-convention reality (DEC-022 Q3) is honored.

## Trace C — advisory match never mutates the spec (Q2 safety + DEC-016)

Command path: Lens 7 prompt (advisory match) + Synthesizer HARD RULE (`commands/audit-coherence.md § "Synthesizer prompt"` step 5 + sanity check 1).

State: Phase 3 renders 4 boxes; the latest `verification-result.json` is a **partial** PASS for Phase 3 (`criteria_failed > 0`, e.g. 3/4), and the fuzzy box↔criterion match is ambiguous (criteria were re-segmented per-task).

1. The lens flags the divergence but explicitly notes where it **cannot confidently match** a box to a criterion (free-text, re-segmented, no ID — DEC-022 Q2) rather than guessing.
2. The synthesizer sees `files_to_touch` includes a spec path → HARD RULE → `kind: decision`; never `bundle-eligible`; never inline-applied (`[Fix it]` is unavailable for this kind).

**Expected:** the finding surfaces for human judgment through `/iterate`; **no** spec box is auto-ticked, and partial-PASS boxes are not blindly flipped. The unsafe-mapping risk that disqualified DEC-022 Option B is contained precisely because the lens never auto-mutates state.

**Pass criteria:** advisory only; reconciliation is a human decision via `/iterate`; the hard rule prevents any inline spec edit regardless of match confidence.

## Trace D — authority doctrine (A): dashboard is the status surface, not the inline boxes

Command path: `rules/spec-workflow.md § "Acceptance-criteria authority"` + `commands/health-check.md` Part 1 acceptance-status note + `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Critical Invariant.

State: Phase 2 verified PASS (`criteria[]` 7/7); spec Phase 2 inline boxes still `- [ ]`.

1. `/health-check` Part 1 completion-gate does **not** treat the unticked spec boxes as a completion failure (the note: boxes are authored input; live status is the dashboard's Acceptance criteria section).
2. A reader/agent consults the dashboard's Acceptance criteria section (7/7) for *status*, and the spec for the *criteria text*.

**Expected:** unticked inline boxes never block completion or raise a false "phase incomplete" signal; the authoritative acceptance-status is `verification-result.json` `criteria[]`.

**Pass criteria:** the authority split is applied consistently (spec = criteria authorship; `verification-result.json` / dashboard = status); no artifact treats stale inline boxes as authoritative status.

## Trace E — historical coverage: a completed *earlier* phase is reconciled via proxy (v4.27.0)

Command path: `commands/audit-coherence.md` Phase 1 capture step 9 (per-phase rollup) → Lens 7 "Two evidence tiers".

State: the project has progressed to **Phase 3** (in progress). `verification-result.json` now holds Phase 3's result (Phase 2's was overwritten). Phases 1 and 2 are complete (all their tasks Finished+verified); the spec's **Phase 2** inline boxes are all `- [ ]` (the flirty-gym leftover); Phase 3's boxes are legitimately `- [ ]` (in progress).

1. Capture builds `inputs/phase-verification.json`: Phase 1 `phase_complete: true`, Phase 2 `phase_complete: true`, Phase 3 `phase_complete: false`.
2. The lens checks each phase that renders boxes:
   - Phase 2 → not the phase in `verification-result.json`, but `phase_complete: true` in the rollup → **proxy divergence** (boxes unticked, phase done).
   - Phase 3 → `phase_complete: false` and not a passing `verification-result.json` → NOT flagged (in-progress; unticked boxes are legitimate).

**Expected:** ONE proxy finding at Phase 2 — *"Phase 2 (proxy): 0/N boxes ticked but all M tasks Finished+verified (phase_complete)."* — even though `verification-result.json` has moved on to Phase 3. Phase 3 is not flagged. This is the gap the single-file model missed: the flirty-gym symptom is now caught after the project advances past the stale phase.

**Pass criteria:** completed earlier phases are reconciled from the per-phase rollup (not just the latest `verification-result.json` phase); the in-progress phase is never flagged; proxy findings are labeled "(proxy)" and still route `kind: decision` → `/iterate`.

## Coverage tiers (DEC-022 v4.27.0 — full historical reconciliation)

The lens reconciles **every completed phase**, via two evidence tiers:
- **Authoritative (latest phase):** `.claude/verification-result.json` (overwritten each phase) gives the real `criteria[]` PASS/FAIL for the phase it currently covers.
- **Proxy (earlier completed phases):** the capture's per-phase rollup (`inputs/phase-verification.json`) marks a phase `phase_complete` when all its non-Absorbed/non-On-Hold tasks are Finished+verified (the phase gate's own completion condition). An unticked box for a `phase_complete` phase is stale.

Residual (honest): the proxy is a per-task signal, marginally weaker than a persisted phase-level `criteria[]` — a phase's cross-task *integration* acceptance criteria aren't separately recorded once `verification-result.json` is overwritten. The lens labels proxy findings as such and routes all reconciliation to a human via `/iterate`, so the weaker signal is adequate for an advisory detector. Persisting per-phase verification history (to make every phase authoritative) is a separate, larger change deliberately left out of DEC-022's scope.

## Invariant checks

- The lens **never edits the spec** — reconciliation routes through `/iterate` (DEC-016 unchanged; spec/decision/vision remain read-only outside `/iterate`).
- **Zero** changes to `agents/verify-agent.md`, `commands/work.md` completion flow, `.claude/settings.json`, or `support/reference/drift-reconciliation.md` — A+C adds doctrine + a read-only advisory lens only (the economy of A+C over the rejected Option B). The v4.27.0 historical-reconciliation enhancement holds this line: the per-phase rollup is computed read-only at capture from existing task state (`phase` + `task_verification`) — no new persistence, no change to the verification model.
- The lens returns `Findings: 0` for box-less specs — an opt-in convention, not a mandate (Q3); it adds no friction to the majority of projects.
- HARD RULE holds: any finding whose `files_to_touch` includes a spec path is `kind: decision`, never `bundle-eligible` — no inline auto-fix path exists for acceptance-box reconciliation.
