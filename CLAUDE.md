## Maintaining This Template

Instructions for working on the claude_code_environment repository itself:

- **Purpose**: Template for bootstrapping Claude Code projects
- **Keep minimal**: Resist adding project-specific content
- **Test changes**: Copy to temp directory and verify workflow works
- **Placeholders**: Use `[bracketed text]` for user-customizable sections

### What NOT to do

- Don't fill in template placeholders with real content
- Don't add files that aren't essential to the template
- Don't add project-specific conventions

# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code when working in this project.

## Project Overview

[Brief description of what this project does]

## How This System Works

**Your primary interface is the dashboard** (`.claude/dashboard.md`). It shows everything you need:
- What needs your attention (decisions, reviews, blockers)
- What Claude is working on
- Timeline and upcoming deadlines
- Progress and recent activity

**What you do:**
- Write code and documentation (outside `.claude/`)
- Make decisions when Claude surfaces options
- Review and approve at phase boundaries
- Update the spec when requirements change

**What Claude does:**
- Tracks tasks and progress (in `.claude/tasks/`)
- Implements according to spec
- Surfaces decision points to you
- Validates work against acceptance criteria

**You shouldn't need to dig into `.claude/` internals** - the dashboard brings everything to you.

## Specification

The project specification lives at `.claude/spec_v{N}.md`.

**Do not edit the specification directly.** If you identify improvements:
1. Quote the relevant section
2. Explain the suggested change
3. Let the user make the edit

To create or revise specifications, start a Claude Code instance from `.claude/specification_creator/`.

## Workflow: Spec → Execute → Verify

This project uses a phased workflow for autonomous work:

1. **Spec** - Define what needs to be built (requirements, constraints, acceptance criteria, key decisions)
2. **Execute** - Build it (tasks decomposed from spec, implementation)
3. **Verify** - Confirm it works (testing, validation against spec)

**Primary command:** `/work` - Intelligent entry point that checks requests against spec, decomposes spec into tasks, and routes to specialist agents.

**Core principle:** The spec is the living source of truth. All work should align with it, or the spec should be updated intentionally.

**Human checkpoints:** At phase boundaries, quality gate failures, and when requests don't align with spec.

## Commands

### Primary
- `/work` - Start or continue work (checks spec alignment, decomposes tasks, routes to agents)
- `/work complete` - Complete current in-progress task (or `/work complete {id}`)
- `/status` - Quick read-only view of project state (no modifications)

### Task Management
- `/breakdown {id}` - Split complex tasks into subtasks
- `/health-check` - Validate tasks, decisions, and CLAUDE.md health

### Setup
- `/setup-check` - Validate template configuration (run after cloning)

## Agent Synergy: Implement + Verify

This project uses two specialist agents that check each other's work:

| Agent | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **implement-agent** | Builder | Executes tasks, writes code, marks tasks finished |
| **verify-agent** | Validator | Tests against spec, finds issues, ensures quality |

**Why two agents?**
A single agent implementing and validating its own work has blind spots.
By separating concerns:
- implement-agent focuses purely on building (no self-validation bias)
- verify-agent validates against the spec with fresh perspective
- Issues caught by verify-agent become new tasks for implement-agent

**The workflow:**
1. `/work` invokes implement-agent for pending tasks
2. implement-agent builds and marks tasks finished
3. When all tasks are done, `/work` invokes verify-agent
4. verify-agent tests against spec acceptance criteria
5. Issues found become new tasks, back to implement-agent

This separation produces higher quality output than a single agent could achieve alone.

## Task Rules

Tasks are tracked in `.claude/tasks/` as JSON files. The **Project Dashboard** at `.claude/dashboard.md` shows:
- 🚨 **Needs Your Attention** - decisions pending, tasks ready for you, reviews needed
- 🎯 **Milestones** - project phase progress and targets
- ⏰ **Timeline** - upcoming deadlines and milestones
- 🤖 **Claude Status** - what Claude is working on
- 📊 **Progress This Week** - recent completions and activity
- 📋 **All Decisions** - decision log with status
- 📝 **All Tasks** - full task list with details
- 💡 **Notes & Ideas** - your preserved notes section

**Key rules:**
- Break down tasks with difficulty >= 7 before starting
- Only one task "In Progress" at a time
- Dashboard regenerates automatically after task changes

See `.claude/support/reference/shared-definitions.md` for difficulty scale, status values, and owner definitions.

## Decisions

Major decisions are documented in `.claude/support/decisions/`.

- **Dashboard tracks all decisions** - Status, pending items, and timeline in one place
- **Records:** `decision-*.md` - full analysis with comparison tables
- **Research:** `.archive/` - background research documents
- **Template:** `.claude/support/reference/decision-template.md`

When facing significant choices, create a decision record rather than deciding inline.

## Workspace

When you need to create temporary documents (research, analysis, drafts), use `.claude/support/workspace/`:

- **scratch/** - Throwaway notes, quick analysis, temporary thinking
- **research/** - Web search results, reference material, gathered context
- **drafts/** - Work-in-progress documents before they move to their final location

**Rules:**
- Never create working documents in the project root or other locations
- Use simple descriptive names (`api-comparison.md`, not `task-5-research.md`)
- When a draft is ready to become permanent, discuss where it should go

## Template Configuration Files

Two files control template behavior:

### sync-manifest.json

Defines which files sync from template updates vs stay project-specific:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `sync` | Updated from template | Commands, agents, reference docs |
| `customize` | User-editable, template provides defaults | CLAUDE.md, README.md, questions.md |
| `ignore` | Project-specific data, never synced | Tasks, dashboard, decision records, learnings |

### settings.local.json

Pre-approved permissions for consistent Claude Code behavior. Ensures the template works the same way for everyone using it. Contains tool permissions that would otherwise require per-session approval.
