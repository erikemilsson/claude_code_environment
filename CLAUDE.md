# Template Repository Context

**You are working on the template itself, not on a project that uses the template.**

The `.claude/` directory contains the environment that ships to new projects. The root-level files (this file, `README.md`, `tests/`) are template maintenance infrastructure.

## What This Means

- **Don't fill in template placeholders** — sections like `[Brief description]` and `[Your license here]` are intentionally blank
- **Don't create project-specific content** — no real specs, tasks, or decisions
- **Don't run `/work` or `/iterate` as if building a project** — these commands are what you're maintaining, not using
- **The spec file (`.claude/spec_v1.md`) should stay as a placeholder** — it's a template for users to fill in
- **The dashboard (`.claude/dashboard.md`) is a populated format example** — unlike other template files that use `[bracketed placeholders]`, the dashboard shows a fictional renovation project mid-execution. This is intentional: it serves as a golden example for Claude to pattern-match when generating dashboards. It gets replaced on first `/work` run.

## What You Should Do

- **Edit command definitions** (`.claude/commands/*.md`) to improve workflow logic
- **Edit agent definitions** (`.claude/agents/*.md`) to improve implementation/verification
- **Edit reference docs** (`.claude/support/reference/*.md`) to improve patterns and schemas
- **Edit `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** to improve environment instructions (template-owned core)
- **Edit `.claude/rules/*.md`** to improve modular workflow rules
- **Edit `.claude/README.md`** to improve the user-facing environment guide
- **Run conceptual tests** (`tests/scenarios/`) after significant command changes
- **Use `[bracketed text]` for user-customizable placeholder sections** (exception: `dashboard.md` uses populated example data instead)

## Template Maintenance Workflow

When making changes to the template, use the `.claude/` command definitions as reference for what you're editing — but don't use the `.claude/` spec/task/dashboard/decision workflow to manage the template's own work (those are template content, not tools).

- **Source of truth:** `system-overview.md` (root) describes the template's design intent
- **Decision records:** `decisions/` (root) — for formal decisions about template changes via `/research`
- **Feedback:** `.claude/support/feedback/` — feedback items about template improvements (this is an exception — feedback is about the template, not template content that ships)

These are template-maintenance artifacts that don't ship to projects.

## Version Bumping

A git pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) warns when sync-category files are committed without bumping `template_version` in `.claude/version.json`. The hook warns but does not block — commit proceeds with a reminder.

**SemVer policy (to be formalized):** Major = breaking changes to command interfaces or task schema. Minor = new features, new commands, significant behavior changes. Patch = bug fixes, wording improvements, threshold adjustments.

Since `.git/hooks/` isn't tracked by git, the hook must be installed manually in each clone. To install:
```bash
cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Testing

The `tests/` directory contains conceptual trace tests for the command definitions. These are not automated — they define a state, reference a command path, and specify expected behavior. Run them by tracing through the command logic to verify correctness. See `tests/README.md`.

## File Boundary

| Location | Purpose | Ships to projects? |
|----------|---------|:--:|
| `.claude/` | Environment that users get | Yes |
| `README.md` | Template documentation | No (users delete) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file — template context (replaced with project-specific `./CLAUDE.md` on setup) | Replaced |
| `system-overview.md` | Environment design reference — lifecycle, features, design intent | No (users delete) |
| `tests/` | Command verification scenarios | No (users delete) |
| `decisions/` | Template-level decision records (via `/research`) | No (users delete) |
| `scripts/` | Template maintenance scripts (pre-commit hook) | No (users delete) |
| `interaction-logs/` | Cross-project session exports and derived insights | No (template repo only) |
| `.gitignore` | Repo config | Partially (users may keep) |
