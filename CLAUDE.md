## Maintaining This Template

Instructions for working on the claude_code_environment repository itself:

- **Purpose**: Template for bootstrapping Claude Code projects
- **Keep minimal**: Resist adding project-specific content
- **Test changes**: Copy to temp directory and verify workflow works
- **Placeholders**: Use `[bracketed text]` for user-customizable sections

### What NOT to do

- Don't fill in template placeholders with real content
- Don't add files that aren't essential to the template
- Don't add project-specific conventions

# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code when working in this project.

## Project Overview

[Brief description of what this project does]

## Specification

The project specification lives at `.claude/spec_v{N}.md`.

**Do not edit the specification directly.** If you identify improvements:
1. Quote the relevant section
2. Explain the suggested change
3. Let the user make the edit

To create or revise specifications, start a Claude Code instance from `.claude/specification_creator/`.

## Workflow: Spec → Execute → Verify

This project uses a phased workflow for autonomous work:

1. **Spec** - Define what needs to be built (requirements, constraints, acceptance criteria, key decisions)
2. **Execute** - Build it (tasks decomposed from spec, implementation)
3. **Verify** - Confirm it works (testing, validation against spec)

**Primary command:** `/work` - Intelligent entry point that checks requests against spec, decomposes spec into tasks, and routes to specialist agents.

**Core principle:** The spec is the living source of truth. All work should align with it, or the spec should be updated intentionally.

**Human checkpoints:** At phase boundaries, quality gate failures, and when requests don't align with spec.

## Commands

### Primary
- `/work` - Start or continue work (checks spec alignment, decomposes tasks, routes to agents)

### Task Management
- `/complete-task {id}` - Start and finish tasks
- `/breakdown {id}` - Split complex tasks into subtasks
- `/sync-tasks` - Update task-overview.md from JSON files
- `/health-check` - Validate tasks, decisions, and CLAUDE.md health
- `/archive-tasks` - Archive old finished tasks
- `/restore-task {id}` - Restore a task from archive

## Task Rules

Tasks are tracked in `.claude/tasks/` as JSON files. The **Project Dashboard** at `.claude/tasks/task-overview.md` shows:
- Quick status with task counts by owner
- ❗ **Your Actions** - human tasks ready or waiting
- 🤖 **Claude Status** - what Claude is working on
- 💡 **Notes & Ideas** - your preserved notes section
- Full task list with all details

**Key rules:**
- Break down tasks with difficulty >= 7 before starting
- Only one task "In Progress" at a time
- Run `/sync-tasks` after completing any task

See `.claude/reference/shared-definitions.md` for difficulty scale, status values, and owner definitions.

## Decisions

Major decisions are documented in `.claude/context/decisions/`.

- **Index:** `index.md` - all decisions with status
- **Records:** `decision-*.md` - full analysis with comparison tables
- **Research:** `.archive/` - background research documents
- **Template:** `.claude/reference/decision-template.md`

When facing significant choices, create a decision record rather than deciding inline.
