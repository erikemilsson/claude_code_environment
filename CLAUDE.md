# Template Repository Context

**You are working on the template itself, not on a project that uses the template.**

The `.claude/` directory contains the environment that ships to new projects. The root-level files (this file, `README.md`, `tests/`) are template maintenance infrastructure.

## What This Means

- **Don't fill in template placeholders** — sections like `[Brief description]` and `[Your license here]` are intentionally blank
- **Don't create project-specific content** — no real specs, tasks, or decisions
- **Don't run `/work` or `/iterate` as if building a project** — these commands are what you're maintaining, not using
- **The spec file (`.claude/spec_v1.md`) should stay as a placeholder** — it's a template for users to fill in
- **The dashboard (`.claude/dashboard.md`) is a populated format example** — unlike other template files that use `[bracketed placeholders]`, the dashboard shows a fictional renovation project mid-execution. This is intentional: it serves as a golden example for Claude to pattern-match when generating dashboards. It gets replaced on first `/work` run.

## What You Should Do

- **Edit command definitions** (`.claude/commands/*.md`) to improve workflow logic
- **Edit agent definitions** (`.claude/agents/*.md`) to improve implementation/verification
- **Edit reference docs** (`.claude/support/reference/*.md`) to improve patterns and schemas
- **Edit `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** to improve project instructions
- **Edit `.claude/README.md`** to improve the user-facing environment guide
- **Run conceptual tests** (`tests/scenarios/`) after significant command changes
- **Use `[bracketed text]` for user-customizable placeholder sections** (exception: `dashboard.md` uses populated example data instead)

## Testing

The `tests/` directory contains conceptual trace tests for the command definitions. These are not automated — they define a state, reference a command path, and specify expected behavior. Run them by tracing through the command logic to verify correctness. See `tests/README.md`.

## File Boundary

| Location | Purpose | Ships to projects? |
|----------|---------|:--:|
| `.claude/` | Environment that users get | Yes |
| `README.md` | Template documentation | No (users delete) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file — template context | No (users delete) |
| `tests/` | Command verification scenarios | No (users delete) |
| `.gitignore` | Repo config | Partially (users may keep) |
